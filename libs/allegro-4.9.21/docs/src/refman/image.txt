# Image I/O addon

These functions are declared in the following header file.
Link with allegro_image.

    #include <allegro5/allegro_image.h>
    

## API: al_init_image_addon

Initializes the image addon.  This registers bitmap format handlers for
[al_load_bitmap], [al_load_bitmap_f], [al_save_bitmap], [al_save_bitmap_f].

The following types are built into the Allegro image addon and guaranteed to be
available: BMP, PCX, TGA. Every platform also supports JPEG and PNG
via external dependencies.

Other formats may be available depending on the operating system and
installed libraries, but are not guaranteed and should not be assumed to
be universally available. 

## API: al_shutdown_image_addon

Shut down the image addon. This is done automatically at program exit,
but can be called any time the user wishes as well.

## API: al_get_allegro_image_version

Returns the (compiled) version of the addon, in the same format as
[al_get_allegro_version].

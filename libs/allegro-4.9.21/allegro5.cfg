# Graphics driver.
# Can be 'default', 'opengl' or 'direct3d' (Windows only).
driver=default

# Can be 'point', 'linear', 'anisotropic'.
# Just a hint, driver doesn't have to obey.
min_filter=point
mag_filter=point

# Display configuration selection mode.

# Under Linux, it can be used to force the old GLX 1.2 way of choosing
# display settings or the new FBConfig method introduced with GLX 1.3.

# Under Windows, when using the OpenGL driver, setting it to old will
# use DescribePixelFormat and new will use wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB
# (provided by WGL_ARB_pixel_format extension).

# FIXME: This was mainly useful for testing (and running in Wine
# versions where the latter was not supported) but should be removed
# before the A5 release:

# Can be 'old' and 'new'. Default is 'new'.
config_selection=new

[audio]

# Driver can be 'default', 'openal', 'alsa', 'oss', 'pulseaudio' or 'directsound'
# depending on platform.
driver=default

# Mixer quality can be 'linear' (default) or 'point'.
# default_mixer_quality=linear

# The frequency to use for the default voice/mixer. Default: 44100.
# primary_voice_frequency=44100
# primary_mixer_frequency=44100

# Can be 'int16', otherwise defaults to float32.
# primary_voice_depth=float32
# primary_mixer_depth=float32

[oss]

# You can skip probing for OSS4 driver by setting this option to 'yes'.
# Default is 'no'.
force_ver3=no

# When OSS3 is used, you can choose a sound device here.
# Default is '/dev/dsp'.
device=/dev/dsp

[alsa]

# Set the ALSA sound device.
# Default is 'default'.
device=default

[directsound]

# Set the DirectSound buffer size (in samples)
buffer_size = 4096

[opengl]

# If you want to support old OpenGL versions, you can make Allegro
# believe an older version than what you actually have is used with
# this key. This is only for testing/debugging purposes.

# force_opengl_version = 1.2

[opengl_disabled_extensions]

# Any OpenGL extensions can be listed here to make Allegro report them
# as not available. The extensions used by Allegro itself if available
# are shown below - uncommenting them would disable them:

# GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two=0
# GL_EXT_framebuffer_object=0


[trace]
# Comma-separated list of channels to log. Default is "all" which
# disables channel filtering. Some possible channels are:
# system,display,keyboard,opengl
# Channel names can be prefixed with - to exclude only those channels.
# Each addon and source-file can define additional channels though so
# there are more.
channels=all

# Log-level. Can be one of debug, info, warn, error.
level=debug

# Set to 0 to disable line numbers in log files.
lines=1

# Set to 0 to disable timestamps in log files.
timestamps=1

# Set to 0 to disable function names in log files.
functions=1

[xkeymap]
# Override X11 keycode. The below example maps X11 code 52 (Y) to Allegro
# code 26 (Z) and X11 code 29 (Z) to Allegro code 25 (Y).
# 52=26
# 29=25

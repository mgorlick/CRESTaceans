We'll probably have some more details on this later today, but we're able to spill some of it now seeing as much of it just went live on Samsung's own site.

If you haven't been keeping up with all the latest in Samsung news, here's what you need to know: Samsung's got a widget interface called TouchWiz, which they've been rolling out across their touchscreen phones since around June of last year. You've got a drawer containing some widgets, and four flickable pages to toss these widgets onto. So far, they've got it up and running on Windows Mobile, Symbian, and Samsung's own proprietary OS. TouchWiz looks and behaves more or less identically on all of these platforms, providing some degree of uniform user experience across vastly different interfaces.

We haven't been huge fans of TouchWiz thus far, largely because of its lack of expandability. Each TouchWiz-enabled device came with 10-15 widgets, and that was that. If you wanted to download more, you were out of luck. If you wanted to make your own, that was just too bad. That's all about to change.]]></description>

One of our reliable sources told us today that they had reason to believe both CBS/CNET and Amazon were considering acquiring the company. After some digging, we've confirmed that CBS has considered investing in GDGT and that their subsidiary CNET has ongoing partnership discussions, but isn't considering an acquisition right now. Amazon, though, is more interesting. They've been doing quiet background due diligence on GDGT's founders and developers, we've heard, which is an indication that they may be interested in buying.

Amazon has experimented with pure content sites the last few years, launching a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/25/hey-thats-pretty-smart-amazon-launches-a-gadget-blog/">bunch of blogs</a> and even <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/14/amazon-acquires-dpreviewcom/">buying UK-based DPReview</a>, a camera review blog, in 2007.  Content, particularly reviews, are great for SEO and cross promotion. And to Amazon's credit, they haven't defiled <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">DPReview</a> much at all.

...and GDGT is certainly off to an amazing start. They had a massive <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/gdgt-draws-47-million-views-during-wwdc-keynote-not-bad-for-a-site-that-hasnt-launched/">4.7 million pageview</a> traffic day back in June, <em>before they launched the main site.</em> Compete shows a <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/gdgt.com/">nice spike</a> in U.S. visitors, without the usual post launch sag (yet).]]></description>

Although I've now cancelled my SpinVox subscription, I know (because CIO Rob Wheatley told me) that SpinVox, like Google, keeps data - which in SpinVox's case means recordings of your messages - "for as long as possible". Based on a quick search of my inbox, I reckon SpinVox are holding recordings of about 250 messages that were left for me between April and July of this year.

But that's not really the problem. After all, Google knows a lot more about me than that and I'm sure my ISP and the government do too. My concern is that I believe the majority of my messages were listened to by a person I don't know in another country. That's the point at which SpinVox may be falling foul of UK and European data regulations, and it's the weak link in the privacy chain. So it's time to find out if SpinVox is being honest enough with its customers about the proportion of messages that are read by humans - and also about how much of those messages are seen by call centre staff. Here's how:]]></description>

Although I&#8217;ve now cancelled my SpinVox subscription, I know (because CIO Rob Wheatley told me) that SpinVox, like Google, keeps data - which in SpinVox&#8217;s case means recordings of your messages - &#8220;for as long as possible&#8221;. Based on a quick search of my inbox, I reckon SpinVox are holding recordings of about 250 messages that were left for me between April and July of this year.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not really the problem. After all, Google knows a lot more about me than that and I&#8217;m sure my ISP and the government do too. My concern is that I believe the majority of my messages were listened to by a person I don&#8217;t know in another country. That&#8217;s the point at which SpinVox may be falling foul of UK and European data regulations, and it&#8217;s the weak link in the privacy chain. So it&#8217;s time to find out if SpinVox is being honest enough with its customers about the proportion of messages that are read by humans - and also about how much of those messages are seen by call centre staff. Here&#8217;s how:

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rocket-fuel-logo.png" width="212" height="80" /> 

A team of Yahoo veterans who built its behavioral targeting advertising technology are publicly launching a hybrid ad network today called<a href="http://www.rocketfuelinc.com/"> Rocket Fuel</a>, which they've tested over the past year with <a href="http://rocketfuelinc.com/html/advertisers/brands.html">major brands</a> including Nike, Dell, Microsoft, and American Express.  Despite keeping quiet, Rocket Fuel's ad network reaches 40 million people and shows them about 100 million ads per month. 

CEO George John calls Rocket Fuel a "hybrid ad network" because it combines all sorts of targeting data (social, behavioral, contextual, geographical, search) to figure out what works best at any particular moment.  "We saw how important it was to let the data tell you which ad to show," says John, who came from Yahoo along with president Richard Frankel and CTO Abhinav Gupta.]]></description>

<p>A team of Yahoo veterans who built its behavioral targeting advertising technology are publicly launching a hybrid ad network today called<a href="http://www.rocketfuelinc.com/"> Rocket Fuel</a>, which they&#8217;ve tested over the past year with <a href="http://rocketfuelinc.com/html/advertisers/brands.html">major brands</a> including Nike, Dell, Microsoft, and American Express.  Despite keeping quiet, Rocket Fuel&#8217;s ad network reaches 40 million people and shows them about 100 million ads per month. </p>
<p>CEO George John calls Rocket Fuel a &#8220;hybrid ad network&#8221; because it combines all sorts of targeting data (social, behavioral, contextual, geographical, search) to figure out what works best at any particular moment.  &#8220;We saw how important it was to let the data tell you which ad to show,&#8221; says John, who came from Yahoo along with president Richard Frankel and CTO Abhinav Gupta.</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel&#8217;s algorithm considers everything from a consumer&#8217;s online behavior and location to the time of day and what particular ad was shown.  If people who listen to electronica music are more likely to click on an ad than those who listen to jazz, or people who log in from work respond better than people from home, Rocket Fuel tries to ferret out those details and feed them back into the mechanics of the ad campaign. John explains:</p>
<p><em>We let the date tell us what works and what is important. Instead of inflicting on customers thousands of targeting options, we figure out which options are working well and move inventory in that way.</em></p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but apparently this is not the way most ad targeting is done.  Instead, advertisers and ad agencies typically are given a confusing array of targeting options and are left to their own devices to sort through them all.  Rocket Fuel is automating that testing process and speeding up the feedback loop so that advertisers can hone in on whatever combination of targeting is working at that second.</p>
<p>But does the world really need another advertising network, hybrid or otherwise?  If Rocket Fuel can deliver better advertising campaign ROIs, advertisers will give it a shot.  That&#8217;s all that matters.  If it can&#8217;t, it won&#8217;t make it off the launchpad.</p>
<p>The companyl raised $6.8 million in a series A round a year ago from Mohr Davidow, Labrador Ventures, and individual angel investors.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, Y Combinator will not be forgoing its usual method of combing over any and all startup pitches outside of the ones they lay out. &#8220;<em>We don&#8217;t expect responses to RFSes will ever be more than a fraction of the applications we accept.

<p>Y Combinator&#8217;s RFSes won&#8217;t describe exactly what Y Combinator is looking for, but rather will give a general idea, with the hopes that the startups can come up with even better plans than Y Combinator is thinking of, Graham says.</p>
<p>So what is the first RFS? Well, it&#8217;s something near and dear to our hearts: <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html">The Future Of Journalism</a>. Y Combinator is wondering what the online content sites will look like in the future when <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/16/the-media-bundle-is-dead-long-live-the-news-aggregators/">print publications are gone</a>. Certainly some, like TechCrunch, have gotten large enough to support themselves now, but most content sites are still built on the notion of content first, monetization later. Y Combinator notes that in the heyday of print media, the approach was often the opposite, there was a business plan in place before the launch. It believes that approach can still work, and has laid out a rough outline of what it&#8217;s looking for from startups that want to do this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Groups applying to work on this idea should include at least one writer who can write well and rapidly about any topic, one or more programmers who are good at statistics, data mining, and making sites scale, and someone who&#8217;s reasonably competent at graphic design.  These functions can of course be combined, and in fact it&#8217;s even better if they are. Xooglers would be particularly well suited to this project.</p></blockquote>
<p>This RFS is just the first of 3 to 5 that Y Combinator hopes to get out there before the October 26 Winter 2010 class application deadline, Graham tells us. Startups applying specifically for these RFS ideas will be able to indicate that on their applications.</p>
<p>Graham notes that Y Combinator has sort of passively given ideas to startups in the past, <a href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html">like this</a>, but thinks this new explicit call will lead to some interesting things.</p>
<p>We asked Graham if this new approach means these types of startups will get different financial deals from Y Combinator. &#8220;<em>Not significantly,</em>&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;<em>Execution matters so much more than the idea that even if we supplied the entire idea we wouldn&#8217;t be entitled to more than 10% of the company,</em>&#8221; he notes. On his post he gives a bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>We might ask for a little more equity from startups responding to an RFS, because we&#8217;d expect to contribute more to them.  But at most a percent or two, and often nothing.  Ideas count for something, but execution matters far more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/that-whining-sound-you-hear-is-the-death-wheeze-of-newspapers/">go again</a>. The newspaper industry is blaming online news aggregators for its dwindling profits and inability to adapt to a world of links and truly-free flowing information.  (They like it when information flows freely into their pages, but not so much when it flows out).  </p>
<p>On Thursday, paidContent ran an essay by media consultant Arnon Mishkin called <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-the-fallacy-of-the-link-economy/">&#8220;The Fallacy Of The Link Economy&#8221;</a> which was <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2009/08/14/on-the-link-economy/">misguided on so many levels</a>.  Mishkin&#8217;s main argument is that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the value gets captured by aggregators linking and scraping rather than by the news organizations that get linked and scraped.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not really clear whom he is calling an aggregator—actual news aggregators like Yahoo News, Google News, Digg, Techmeme and the Huffington Post, or anyone who links to a news story.  After all, he equates the entire web to the blogosphere, which says more about his parochial industry view than about the web.  In his mind, the web is the enemy and links are bad.</p>
<p>What really seems to concern him, however, are news aggregation sites. They threaten newspapers because they are emerging as the new front page which people skim every morning for headlines instead of going to any single newspaper site.  Mishkin argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, the value of those casual browsers was captured by the newspaper because the readers would have to buy a copy.  Now all the value gets captured by the aggregator that scrapes the copy and creates a front page that a set of readers choose to scan. </p></blockquote>
<p>Set aside for a second that ads on news aggregation sites are usually worth a lot less than ads on original content sites and thus they are not capturing the same value.  More to the point, when I first read this my <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287210941">immediate response</a> was that the value of news sites does not come from getting people to skim headlines, but to actually click through and read the actual stories.  The newspaper industry wants to go back to the world before the Web, when each newspaper was a small media bundle packed with stories, 80 percent of which sucked.  But it didn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;d gladly pay a dollar to read the one or two stories that caught your eye on the front page, hoping there would be more inside.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?   <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287258566">The media bundle is dead.</a>  News sites can no longer capture reader&#8217;s attention with 20 percent news, and <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287251428">80 percent suck</a>.  Each story stands on its own in a world of atomized content where readers can come from anywhere on the Web, not just the front page.  Now in addition to the front page, there are a million side doors.  Reader lock-in is gone. The sooner newspapers get used to that concept, the sooner they can start to adapt and survive.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the value of news aggregators. The newspaper industry is looking for someone to blame.  Usually, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/11/does-google-really-control-the-news/">it&#8217;s Google</a>, but really anyone on the Web will do.  Rather than blame the aggregators, news site should take advantage of them.  On the Web, every side door can be a front page, whether it is Google News or search or Digg or Twitter or a feed reader or My Yahoo.  I&#8217;ve said this before about Google, but it applies to any site that links to the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google does not control the news, it exposes it.  . . . It is incumbent upon each of us to attract an audience by having something original or interesting to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if a news site or a blog can say enough interesting things enough times that news aggregators (or other sites) keep linking to them, then they can build up their brand and reader loyalty.  Maybe readers will click on those links if they see it is coming from a trusted source, and then maybe some of those will start coming to the news site itself on a regular basis.  But that loyalty must be earned every day, story by story, post by post.  The more front pages (or side pages) which point to a news site&#8217;s stories, the more chances it has to gain that loyalty.  </p>
<p>But the days of the media bundle when readers got all of the day&#8217;s news from one site are long gone. So too are gone the cushy days when newspapers could count &#8220;casual browsers&#8221; as real readers and sell them to advertisers.  Newspapers had better get used to a world where links exist and can whisk readers away as quickly as they bring them.  Those who don&#8217;t will learn that trying to recreate the past is a sure a path to an early grave.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cr-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" />We've been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/chrome-for-mac-starting-to-look-polished/">gushing for weeks</a> now about the latest Chromium builds for Mac. Every day, they seem to get better. The problem is that every day, several updates are released and you have to manually go to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/">the site</a> and scroll down a long list to find the newest version to download. So we've made an application that allows you to easily ensure that you have the latest version at all times.

Our Mac Chromium Updater was built with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/grosen">Greg Rosen</a>, who created a script to check your version of Chromium versus the latest build. Then one of our developers, <a href="http://twitter.com/hunt3131">Hunter</a>, created an Automator process so you don't have to deal with installing something like Wget on your machine. The end result is a simple app that you run and let it update Chromium for you. <strong><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/chromium-updater.zip">You can find it here</a></strong>.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cr.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot2" alt="" />We&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/chrome-for-mac-starting-to-look-polished/">gushing for weeks</a> now about the latest Chromium builds for Mac.

<p>Our Mac Chromium Updater was built with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/grosen">Greg Rosen</a>, who created a script to check your version of Chromium versus the latest build. Then one of our developers, <a href="http://twitter.com/hunt3131">Hunter</a>, created an Automator process so you don&#8217;t have to deal with installing something like Wget on your machine. The end result is a simple app that you run and let it update Chromium for you. <strong><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/chromium-updater.zip">You can find it here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t aware, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)">Chromium</a> is the open source project behind Google&#8217;s web browser, Chrome. While there are pre-release versions of regular Chrome available for Mac as well, the Chromium builds get updated much more frequently, and as such, are the closest to a working version of Chrome on the Mac. For example, latest versions of Chromium include <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/dont-look-now-but-flash-is-kind-of-working-on-chrome-for-mac/">Flash support</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/chrome-for-mac-continues-march-forward-with-bookmarks-and-better-flash/">bookmark support</a>. Overall, the project is coming along very nicely.</p>
<p>A couple quick notes about our app: First, when you run the app, depending on the speed of your connection, it may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to download the newest build of Chromium. So even if you don&#8217;t think the app is doing anything, let it run, and eventually you will see the latest build of Chromium open on your screen. Second, this has only been tested of OS X 10.5 Leopard, but Chromium will only run on Leopard, so there you go.</p>
<p>Enjoy. We&#8217;ve included a read me file in the zip with a few more obvious disclaimers and a note of who to email with problems.</p>

Hewitt also says he'll post screen shots and more detais on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6628568379">this</a> Facebook page for the iPhone app next week, and that he's looking forward to getting started on v. 3.1 tomorrow.

We've been tracking 3.0 since details first became available in July.

<blockquote><p>That means that shortly, we’ll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook’s site, the ability to “like” items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have video support for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly. And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s likely Apple will approve this app in short order. Not only are they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/15/phil-schiller-is-a-man-on-a-mission-to-save-the-app-store/">trying to avoid</a> high profile app problems, there&#8217;s also not very much in the Facebook app that they or AT&#038;T would take exception to.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard it, make sure to listen to our <a href="http://www.talkcrunch.com/2007/08/23/interview-with-joe-hewitt-iphone-god/">interview with Joe Hewitt</a> two years ago when Facebook first launched a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/15/facebook-iphone-ultrahype/">special browser-based version of Facebook</a> for the iPhone.</p>

 AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.

<p><em>This guest post was written by <strong>Alex Ahlund</strong>, founder of <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee</a>.</em></p>
<p>We are just past of a year since the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/">App Store launched</a> and there are more than 60,000 applications released for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  When we wrote our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/31/a-look-at-some-of-the-best-iphone-apps-of-2008/">2008 year-end app wrap-up</a>, we had just surpassed the 10,000 app milestone.  In early June 2009, the store reached <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/40-million-iphones-and-ipod-touches-and-50000-apps/">50,000 apps</a>.  At present, we are looking at a staggering 300 new applications being released every single day.  How does the average iPhone user find the gems in this deluge?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process is entirely overwhelming for the average iPhone user.  The bulk of consumers use iTunes’ Top and front page listings.  Since placement on the top lists is derived entirely from unit sales, there is a disturbing skew towards the $.99 applications.  This not only discourages big developers from putting high budgets and serious resources towards development of really useful applications and games, but also does a disservice to us, as iPhone users.  If all we see are ninety-nine cent gimmicks and toys, how will we realize the true potential of our device?  Apple attempts to offset this with editor’s picks, but this simply isn’t enough to make sense of the App Store.</p>
<p>There are new third party services and tools coming onto the scene to help show how to best navigate the App Store.  AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.</p>
<p>The following is a round-up of our top picks so far this year:</p>
<p><strong>Most practical</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-slacker-radio">Slacker Radio</a></strong></p>
<p>A fantastic alternative to Pandora, which carries a larger catalog and offers Premium accounts that offers something we’ve always loathed about Pandora – unlimited song skips. (Similar: <a href="http://www.pandora.com/on-the-iphone">Pandora</a>, <a href="http://www.wunderradio.com/">WunderRadio</a>, <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>)</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/lPFdmjR30kM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lPFdmjR30kM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object><strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-hey-where-are-you"></a></strong></p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-hey-where-are-you">Hey Where Are You</a></strong><br />
A beautifully simple application that takes advantage of Push Notification, by letting users ask and answer the question “Hey, Where Are You?” (Similar: <a href="http://www.loopt.com">Loopt</a>)</p>

As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.

It's a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It's probably something to do with being a geek.

Arrington's reply was both a confirmation and a warning: "<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you're fired."]]></description>

<p>As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It&#8217;s probably something to do with being a geek.</p>
<p>Arrington&#8217;s reply was both a confirmation and a warning: &#8220;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you&#8217;re fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s official: Penn and Teller - the magicians&#8217; magicians - are coming to TechCrunch 50 next month. Your response to this news will probably depend on which part of the technology barrel you inhabit. For those scraping along at the bottom - the self-described &#8217;social media consultants&#8217;, the me-too-rip-off app builders, the spammers, the search engine optimisation goons, the MySpace child groomers - it might be one of confusion. I mean, what could a couple of Las Vegas magicians possibly know about launching a technology product?</p>
<p>But for anyone else: anyone who understands that technology can actually be an art form rather than just a way to fleece gullible punters, the pairing of tech and magic makes perfect sense. I mean, Penn and Teller at TechCrunch 50 is basically the physical manifestation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Arthur C Clarke&#8217;s third law</a>: &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clarke&#8217;s law, of course, was little more than a useful crutch; a maxim that - by his own admission - he bolted on to his previous two (<em>&#8220;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right.&#8221; / &#8220;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible&#8221;</em>) because he decided three was a better number.</p>
<p>Also, by likening the kind of super-advanced technologies he wrote about to &#8216;real&#8217; magic Clarke could avoid Jules Verne&#8217;s problem of having to explain how his wonderful inventions worked, only for actual innovation to prove him wrong a few years later. Clarke&#8217;s point was that contemporary readers couldn&#8217;t possibly understand how his future technologies worked, they just did. Like magic. No further explanation required.</p>
<p>But in fact Clarke&#8217;s basic premise - that, at a certain level, the line between magic and technology becomes invisible - is absolutely right, just maybe for different reasons than he described.  Speak to any decent magician - one who has read his <a href="http://www.lybrary.com/modern-magic-p-121.html">Professor Hoffman</a> or at least his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Wilsons-Complete-Course-Magic/dp/0894716239">Mark Wilson</a> - and he will tell you about the time he saw a trick (or &#8216;effect&#8217;) that absolutely blew his mind, despite knowing every one of the technical principles behind it.</p>
<p>The one that stands out for me was the time - I was maybe 14 years old - that I watched an American magician called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williamson_(magician)">David Williamson</a> instantly restore a piece of rope that he had previously cut in half, using his fingers as a pair of scissors. The cut and restored rope is an ancient classic of magic, and there&#8217;s really only one way to do it. And yet the way Williamson employed that method was so good - so mind-blowingly, knee-shakingly good - that it (literally) made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
<p>And so it should be with technology. I remember - just as vividly as I remember David Williamson&#8217;s rope trick - the first time I bought a laptop with WiFi. For ten minutes or more I carried that laptop around my house, up and down stairs; into different rooms; even into my back yard, streaming full-screen video from the BBC website as I went. Again, I knew exactly what was going on: there was the WiFi card jutting from the PCMCIA port and I&#8217;d just spent ten minutes configuring the wireless hub. And yet&#8230; the experience of watching full-screen video on my laptop, without wires, was as near to pure magic as watching that piece of rope mend itself two feet from my eyes.</p>
<p>The comparisons between really good uses of the principles of magic and really good uses of technology are so numerous that they could fill a book. In the 1930&#8217;s, Charles Hoffman caused a sensation with a small brass tea-kettle that could - on command - pour any drink or cocktail that the audience requested. Today my iPhone, with its 3G connection and iTunes, can do the same for any piece of music ever recorded. Which one is more magical to watch, really?</p>
<p>Or consider Criss Angel who, using some invisible - but quite basic - method is able to tell a woman on Las Vegas Boulevard the precise date she was born, or what she does for a living. With Google I can summon any fact ever recorded, from wherever I happen to be in the world. Again, which is more impressive? Certainly neither is made less magical by knowing, broadly, how it works. The brilliance lies in how well the method is hidden, and how powerful the effect is.</p>
<p>And so it is with every single brilliant piece of technology, or web app that has ever been created. From the cellphone, to the iPod; from webcams to the web to WiFi. From email to eBay to Twitter to Hotmail to Shazzam to GPS to Google Maps to the Kindle. Pick your favourite, and remember how you felt when you first used it. Now remember the best magic trick you ever saw. The feeling is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Like all good rules, this one works the other way around as well. Remember the exact opposite of the best magic trick you ever saw. Your boring uncle&#8217;s card trick - the one where, through the most convoluted of methods, probably involving dividing the pack into piles and counting slowly through them - he triumphantly, and boringly, turned over the card you chose. Remember how he made you feel: you probably didn&#8217;t know what bizzare mathematics or slight of hand genius lead him to your card, but neither did you care. If he were a real magician, he&#8217;d have found the card straight away. The only person he impressed was himself.</p>
<p>The same is true of the worst technology. I don&#8217;t care how technically sophisticated <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/15/putting-wolfram-alpha-to-the-test-not-super-impressed-but-here-are-50-invites/">Wolfram Alpha</a> is, or how many genius hours it took to build it - all I know is that it forced me to think too hard, and returned results that were of no use to man nor beast. The technological equivalent of a boring uncle; the method was more impressive than the effect, and so the hairs on the back of my neck remain unstood.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Penn and Teller.</p>
<p>Of all of the magicians working today, none more perfectly illustrates the rule that a magical effect must take precedence over technical brilliance. Their stage show is a spectacular of blood and gore and guns and showgirls and pyrotechnics - and yet for their signature piece, they clear all of that aside and perform the oldest and most widely-known effect in magic: the cups and balls.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen it before, of course. Three cups, three little balls. One by one the balls vanish and, one by one, they reappear under the cups. Then, by way of a kicker, the cups are lifted to reveal three limes, one under each. But there&#8217;s more! The cups are stacked and lifted one last time to reveal - a huge lemon. Four large pieces of fruit from under three cups: cue the applause.</p>
<p>But while every magician since the ancient Egyptians has finished there, Penn and Teller announce that they are going to do the trick one more time: this time using transparent cups. It&#8217;s amazing to watch: every single load, every single sleight and steal is laid bare. You see the moment they put the limes under the cups. You even see the lemon go in. But such is the brilliance of their execution, that you&#8217;re still left both baffled and blown away. The method becomes irrelevant, the effect is everything. The audience is on their feet.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s for that reason that I&#8217;m so delighted that Penn and Teller will be at Techcrunch 50. Not for what they&#8217;re launching - although from what I&#8217;ve heard, it&#8217;s going be pretty damn cool - but rather for what their appearance will hopefully remind anyone getting ready to launch a product, either at the event or at any time in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how clever your technology - if the effect doesn&#8217;t make the hairs on the back of your audience&#8217;s neck stand up, you need to keep working until it does. But if you do manage to build something even half as impressive as that lemon appearing under that plastic cup, then fame, fortune and a well-deserved standing ovation will be yours for the taking.</p>

<p>Then, as you see from the above screenshot, we learn that Borders is talking up something <a HREF="http://www.maclife.com/article/news/borders_survey_name_drops_apple_ipad">called the iPad</a>, a noble and befitting name for a device that is a Pad and is made by Apple. I did a <a HREF="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield">trademark search</a> and came up with bupkus, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t assign it by January.</p>
<p>The Borders survey asks if you&#8217;re planning to buy an Apple IPAD (Large Screen Reading Device),&#8221; which either suggest someone at Borders is taking the piss or they have horrible web designers never talk to legal.</p>
<p>This is all well and good but of what are we certain? We know that upcoming <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/search/ipod+camera">iPods will have cameras</a> come September 8 or so and <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/search/apple+tablet">that the iPad</a> or whatever it will be called will drop in 2010. All the rest of these rumors and videos are just icing on the already delicious Apple future device cake.</p>

<ol>
	<li>It's the location of Google's San Francisco office (floors 2-4)</li>


	<li>It's the location of the Secret Service's San Francisco field office (floors 5-6)</li>


	<li>And someone who works there has a license plate that says "Drunk"</li>

</ol>

Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to theorize how these three facts form the backbone of a massive worldwide conspiracy.  Feel free to add additional "facts," such as <em>"That building was also constructed on top of an ancient Native American burial ground"</em> or <em>"I heard that's where the Secret Service keeps all the counterfeit cash they confiscate, and the floors are really thin."</em>  Just make sure to bake in the drunk license plate, too.

<p>Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to theorize how these three facts form the backbone of a massive worldwide conspiracy.  Feel free to add additional &#8220;facts,&#8221; such as <em>&#8220;That building was also constructed on top of an ancient Native American burial ground&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;I heard that&#8217;s where the Secret Service keeps all the counterfeit cash they confiscate, and the floors are really thin.&#8221;</em>  Just make sure to bake in the drunk license plate, too.</p>
<p>I took <a href="http://techcrunch.posterous.com/risky">that picture</a> of the license plate, by the way, in the parking garage of that building. And a different picture of it ended up on the <a href="http://failblog.org/2009/07/18/license-plate-fail-5/">FailBlog last month</a>. So if you can work that into your conspiracy theory, you get bonus points.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92533" title="ref_phil_schiller2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ref_phil_schiller2.jpg" alt="ref_phil_schiller2" width="200" height="289" />As Apple&#8217;s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing, you&#8217;d have to imagine that <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Phil Schiller</a> is a pretty busy guy. He&#8217;s also been moonlighting as Apple&#8217;s keynote speaker during Steve Jobs&#8217; medical leave of absence. But now it&#8217;s really starting to look as if Schiller has taken on another task: App Store savior.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already talked at length about the two instances in the past week or so of Schiller personally <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/apples-phil-schiller-speaks-on-censored-iphone-dictionaries-but-ignores-the-bigger-issues/">reaching out to bloggers</a> to set the record straight about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/schiller-reaches-out-again-to-acknowledge-app-store-problems/">a few of the App Store issues</a>. But he has actually taken it a step farther. He&#8217;s also been reaching out to individual app makers to talk to them about their apps and offer his assistance in getting them approved, we&#8217;ve learned tonight. </p>
<p>And one such app, Rising Card, is now available in the App Store thanks to Schiller.</p>
<p>Rising Card is a magic application developed by <a href="http://theory11.com/">Theory11</a>. The reason it was initially rejected after a long period of hearing nothing from Apple was that they felt the app would be confusing to customers. Of course, that was the point of the app as it&#8217;s a magic trick meant to confuse people. The developers wrote Apple to explain that to them, but heard nothing back. They figured all hope was lost as this was hardly a high profile application, and Apple clearly didn&#8217;t seem to care too much about it.</p>
<p>Then the magic blog <a href="http://itricks.com/news/2009/08/is-apple-unreasonably-cracking-down-on-magic-apps/">iTricks picked up the story</a> which led the Apple blog <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/08/11/magic-trick-developers-find-the-trick-is-on-them/">TUAW to cover the rejection</a> a few days ago, and all of a sudden, Apple started reaching out to the developers. And of course, not just anyone at Apple, but Schiller and also Phil Shoemaker, Apple&#8217;s Director of Application Technology. Based on this and Schiller&#8217;s previous responses, it would seem that not only is Apple reading the blogs that cover App Store issues, but it really is trying to resolve them. And in this case it did. Shoemaker called yesterday to let the developers know that the app was now in the store.</p>
<p>Obviously, the developers are very pleased with situation. Jonathan Bayme, the CEO of Theory11 wrote this to us this evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>Schiller was unbelievably responsive throughout the whole ordeal. Our first communication from him was late at night on the 11th - with another email sent to us an hour later. He was extremely nice and although not promising anything, he said he would have their team look into the situation ASAP.</p>
<p>To be frank, Chris and I [the creators] were both amazed that this had reached the heights it had at all - given the fact that it is just a fun magic trick. We had spent months creating, polishing, and finishing this thing - and up until then we thought all hope was lost. It&#8217;s been quite the rollercoaster.</p>
<p>This morning, we received another email from Schiller advising us that Phil Shoemaker (Director of Application Technology) would be in touch with us soon to discuss our app, and as promised I received a phone call about three hours later from Phil. Shoemaker said that his team was looking into the issue as we spoke, and he was hopeful to see resolution of this by the end of the day.</p>
<p>True to his word - it was in fact approved late this afternoon. In sincerity the whole process was quite the ordeal, but I must say that I respect the hell out of the fact that we received the personal attention that we did. They were responsive, attentive, and truly listened to what we were saying. While one could argue that it took us over a <em>month</em> to get to that point, I would judge this situation based on the lengths they went to to fix the problem - they were incredible.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you go, another happy customer. This new Schiller strategy seems to be working wonders for the App Store.</p>
<p>But I still find it a little crazy that it&#8217;s Schiller who is personally doing this. On one hand it&#8217;s great, but it&#8217;s also odd. Perhaps that speaks to this being more serious of a situation then just some apps being rejected. After all, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC is looking into</a> Apple&#8217;s role in the App Store and how it handles app approvals/rejections. This follows Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of the Google Voice app and the removal of all apps that use Google Voice. Google and AT&amp;T are also the subjects of that investigation.</p>
<p>When the government gets involved — the government that is already looking into Apple for its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/ftc-commends-schmidt-for-stepping-down-then-steps-up-investigation/">board of director issues</a> (with Google), <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/dvd-jon-posts-his-apple-anti-trust-subpoena/">anti-competitive issues</a> (with iTunes/iPod), and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/source-apple-and-google-agreed-not-to-poach-workers/">hiring practice</a> issues (again, with Google) — you are naturally going to take things a little more seriously than you were before. The fact of the matter is that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/the-case-against-apple-is-just-as-much-a-case-for-apple/">Apple had, and still has</a>, a lot of problems with the App Store. They waited too long to fix them, and the situation started to get out of control. So it looks like Apple may have had to bring out the big guns to restore order.</p>
<p>Now, Schiller and Shoemaker cannot possibly personally look into every app, or even just every app rejection, but they appear to be focusing on the ones that are getting attention. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this was some kind of stop-gap move until the improvements to the App Store approval process that Schiller has been alluding to are ready to go. We know they&#8217;ve already broken up the iPhone PR team into <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/another-positive-sign-for-the-app-store-proof-of-a-pr-team/">two divisions now</a> (hardware and App Store), a next step could well be a complete revamping of the app approval process and team.</p>
<p>When MobileMe was having troubles following its launch last year, Steve Jobs stepped in to right the ship, and it worked. It looks like Schiller may be doing the same now with the App Store. Let&#8217;s hope that works too.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Rising Card application that led to all of this? It&#8217;s pretty good, very smartly designed. Is there any reason Apple should have rejected it? No, and so it&#8217;s good to see it in the App Store where it belongs. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=324247209&amp;mt=8">Find it here</a> for $2.99.

But so far this year, Gmail's unique visitors grew 25 percent, while AOL's declined 22 percent.  Thus, the two crossed paths in July.  (Hotmail grew only 8 percent during the same period, while Yahoo Mail increased unique visitors by a healthy 16 percent).]]></description>

<p>If Google wants Gmail to pass Hotmail quickly and gain the No. 2 spot, my suggestion is to keep pumping in new enhancements through Gmail Labs and to speed up the pace at which mail storage increases.  Not that I am a typical user, but I am already at 97 percent of my allotted 7,358 megabytes.  One of the primary lures of Gmail has always been its seemingly endless and ever-expanding storage limits.  Please don&#8217;t make me pay for more storage.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0149/20149v1-max-250x250.png" class="shot2"/>It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but it&#8217;s almost here: <a href="http://www.tapulous.com">Tapulous</a> is putting the finishing touches on Tap Tap Revenge 3, the next installment of its wildly sucessful iPhone music game.  The game, which is best described as a &#8220;Guitar Hero for the iPhone&#8221;, will feature in-game song purchases, which were finally enabled with the release of the iPhone 3.0 software update in June.  If there&#8217;s a game ripe to make a killing with these in-game downloads, it&#8217;s TTR.  Tapulous expects to have the game submitted by the end of August, with general release soon thereafter depending on the App Store&#8217;s approval process.</p>
<p>So why does this matter?  Tap Tap Revenge and its various spinoffs has been some of the iPhone&#8217;s most popular games since the App Store launched last year (in fact, a very similar game was very popular on jailbroken phones before the official store even launched). Gameplay consists of tapping your fingers to a song as colorful bubbles fall down the screen, and newer versions also make use of the phone&#8217;s accelerometer so you can shake it to the beat.  As with games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, TTR tends to appeal to a very broad audience.</p>
<p>But until now it&#8217;s been handicapped by one major obstacle: there was no way for users to pay to download new songs.  On console games like Rock Band, in-game purchases have proven <i>very</i> lucrative with gamers regularly plopping down around $2 per song.   But the iPhone didn&#8217;t allow for this kind of transaction until recently, so Tapulous was forced to sell satellite games like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/04/tapulous-brings-weezer-and-world-class-djs-to-tap-tap-revenge/">TTR Weezer</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/03/tapulous-to-release-coldplay-edition-of-tap-tap-revenge-next-week/">TTR Coldplay</a>, which did well but never saw nearly the usage of the main TTR app.  Now they&#8217;ll be able to license songs from directly inside the flagship app, which means the number of paid downloads will likely skyrocket.  It will also likely be easier to get premium artists on the platform, as they will be able to sell a song or two at a time rather than entire albums.</p>
<p>As a teaser, Tapulous has sent us the following frustratingly small screenshot:</p>

Previously the service only offered users the ability to sample 30 second clips of songs, or restricted full streaming via a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/20/ilike-launches-full-song-playback-and-ad-platform/">partnership with Rhapsody</a> (now phased out).

iLike says the first song purchased today was <a href="http://www.ilike.com/artist/Ernie+Haase+%2526+Signature+Sound/track/Get+Away%2C+Jordan">Get Away, Jordan</a> by Ernie Haase &#038; Signature Sound. Music is available from all four major labels and "hundreds of indie labels, enabled via MediaNet."

Rumors of the music store were <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10292389-93.html">first reported</a> by CNET's Greg Sandoval last month. Until now iLike has offered downloads from Amazon and iTunes. Those options remain.

The service is rolling out now on iLike (I was able to purchase a song), and should be available to all U.S. users by end of day, says iLike. iLike applications on iGoogle, Facebook, Bebo and other platforms will also be available "soon" says the company for U.S. users.

<p>Rumors of the music store were <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10292389-93.html">first reported</a> by CNET&#8217;s Greg Sandoval last month. Until now iLike has offered downloads from Amazon and iTunes. Those options remain.</p>

<p>In an email exchange, iLike CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ali-partovi">Ali Partovi</a> said: </p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re enabling the millions of music fans who discover and share music on iLike to purchase songs in-page directly from iLike.  Our solution provides a smooth, immediate in-page purchase experience. You can sign up, enter your credit card, and download the music you just bought &#8212; all without ever leaving the web page you were on when you discovered the song.</p>
<p>We’re making it easier and more immediate for music fans to buy MP3s as an online on-Web activity. iTunes already provides a great music buying experience inside a media player, and we’ll continue offering our users the option to jump off iLike to purchase from iTunes. At the same time, we’re filling a void by providing a faster way to make impulse music purchases on the web. Our social features and integration into all the major social networks will create a unique music discovery and purchasing experience for music fans across the Web.</p>
<p>The iLike in-page download solution was achieved via direct deals with major labels and a relationship with MediaNet to support the back end fulfillment and provide indie label catalogs. PayPal is providing billing support.</p>
<p>Going forward we&#8217;ll continue to enhance our download service, which is currently in Beta, as well as making it available on other leading third party websites where iLike is embedded. Our goal over time is to offer music fans the ability to impulse buy in-page from wherever they are.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other recent news about iLike, the company is rumored to be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/ilike-negotiating-a-reorganization-ticketmaster-may-be-flushed-out/">raising new capital</a> in an unusual transaction designed to push out Ticketmaster, an investor since 2006.</p>

To get started, it's probably a good idea to run the <i>man</i> command to get a list of the site's main features.  TweetShell just launched a few hours ago so it's buggy and is missing some common Twitter functionality, but it has most of the basics: you can login using either OAuth or the 'old' less secure way, you can tweet from your account using the <i>wall</i> command, and you can browse through tweets from other users using the directory commands like <i>cd</i> and <i>ls</i>.  ]]></description>

TweetShell just launched a few hours ago so it&#8217;s buggy and is missing some common Twitter functionality, but it has most of the basics: you can login using either OAuth or the &#8216;old&#8217; less secure way, you can tweet from your account using the <i>wall</i> command, and you can browse through tweets from other users using the directory commands like <i>cd</i> and <i>ls</i>.  There are also a number of more advanced commands, though frankly I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out how some of them work (feel free to leave tips in the comments).</p>
<p>Of course, there are already a number of Twitter clients that actually run from the terminal, but this runs from the browser, which means it&#8217;s more accessible for casual use and you can access it from any computer.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.yamli.com">Habib Haddad</a> for the tip.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Here&#8217;s another nifty Twitter <a href="http://wcons.s3.amazonaws.com/c.htm">web console</a> that&#8217;s worth checking out if you like TweetShell.</p>

And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/41bbc044/i-ve-seen-this-stupid-yahoo-site-dozens-of-times">saying about</a> a new Yahoo site, <a href="http://yahoo.knowyourmojo.com/">Know Your Mojo!</a> — and he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>The site claims to tell you what kind of &#8220;social mojo&#8221; you possess by analyzing your tweets. It&#8217;s a very simple site, below the big &#8220;What&#8217;s Your Social Mojo?&#8221; question it asks you to put in your Twitter username. You then hit the submission button and it takes you through an animation of a series of pipes. You&#8217;re spit on on the other end with what kind of Twitter user you are. The only problem? It&#8217;s different just about every time you put in your user name.</p>
<p>Of the 16 different mojo possibilities, I&#8217;ve gotten 3 different ones on 4 attempts. Scoble notes similar results. So I don&#8217;t know what kind of analyzing it&#8217;s doing, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to work too well. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t really matter because what this is really about is advertising <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/20/new-yahoo-home-page-tomorrow-heres-what-it-looks-like/">Yahoo&#8217;s new homepage</a>. It makes that pretty clear on the results page that tells you to feed your &#8220;mojo&#8221; by checking out Yahoo&#8217;s site and adding content to it.</p>
<p>While all of that has actually nothing to do with Twitter, Yahoo clearly made a Twitter analyzer to take advantage of the viral nature of the service, hoping the masses would tweet out their results and get more people to visit the site, and then Yahoo&#8217;s homepage. Sadly, it will probably work, even if the analyzer itself doesn&#8217;t.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1111-211x200.png" width="211" height="200" />There's <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=webfinger">some excitement</a> around the web today among a certain group of high profile techies. What are they so excited about? Something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a>, and the fact that Google is apparently getting serious about supporting it. So what is it?

It's an extension of something called the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">finger protocol</a>" that was used in the earlier days of the web to identify people by their email addresses. As the web expanded, the finger protocol faded out, but the idea of needing <a href="http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html">a unified way to identify yourself</a> has not. That's why you keep hearing about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and the like all the time.

But those standards, while open, have failed to latch on in a meaningful way with the public at large. One of the holdups is that you have to set up a website or service you use to be your OpenID. It's relatively easy to do, and you may already have one ready to go, but just not realize it. But it's still kind of tricky to explain to a regular web user — wait, you login with your website?]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92383" title="picture-1111" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1111.png" alt="picture-1111" width="304" height="288" />There&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=webfinger">some excitement</a> around the web today among a certain group of high profile techies. What are they so excited about? Something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a>, and the fact that Google is apparently getting serious about supporting it. So what is it?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an extension of something called the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">finger protocol</a>&#8221; that was used in the earlier days of the web to identify people by their email addresses. As the web expanded, the finger protocol faded out, but the idea of needing <a href="http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html">a unified way to identify yourself</a> has not. That&#8217;s why you keep hearing about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and the like all the time.</p>
<p>But those standards, while open, have failed to latch on in a meaningful way with the public at large. One of the holdups is that you have to set up a website or service you use to be your OpenID. It&#8217;s relatively easy to do, and you may already have one ready to go, but just not realize it. But it&#8217;s still kind of tricky to explain to a regular web user — wait, you login with your website?</p>
<p>But something everyone on the web knows is their email address. And they&#8217;re conditioned by services like Google and Facebook to use it as their identifier. The problem with it has been that it&#8217;s just a string of text, nothing more. You cannot attach information to it to let others know a bit more about you — something vital for true identification. Then idea behind WebFinger is that you should be able to attach any information you choose to your email address.</p>
<p>The excitement today is that a group of Googlers have apparently finally not only gotten Google&#8217;s support to pursue the project, but that they have started working the technical details. As Googler <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-fitzpatrick">Brad Fitpatrick</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/browse_thread/thread/4b367d78ef81c61d?hl=en">writes today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, we&#8217;ve eliminated both technical &amp; political hurdles.  We can now work on this spec, implement, push, try, rinse, repeat&#8230;. until we&#8217;re all reasonable happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Googler <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brett-slatkin">Brett Slatkin</a> (incidentally, Fitzpatrick&#8217;s partner in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/speeding-up-rss/">making PubSubHubbub</a>) explains to us that while it hasn&#8217;t been turned on yet, and that there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do on the spec, the idea is to go into testing mode soon. Fitzpatrick notes that there will be a small experiment going on internally with some Googlers&#8217; Gmail accounts.</p>
<p>Without knowing much about the technical details behind it, the core idea behind WebFinger immediately strikes me as a good one. It&#8217;s taking something everyone knows on the web (your email address) and making it immensely more valuable as a way to identify yourself and information about you. Exactly what kind of information? Here are some of the ideas from the WebFinger Google Code <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/browse_thread/thread/4b367d78ef81c61d?hl=en">page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>public profile data</li>
<li>pointer to identity provider (e.g. OpenID server)</li>
<li>a public key</li>
<li>other services used by that email address (e.g. Flickr, Picasa, Smugmug, Twitter, Facebook, and usernames for each)</li>
<li>a URL to an avatar</li>
<li>profile data (nickname, full name, etc)</li>
<li>whether the email address is also a JID, or explicitly declare that it&#8217;s NOT an email, and ONLY a JID, or any combination to disambiguate all the addresses that look like something@somewhere.com</li>
<li>or even a public declaration that the email address doesn&#8217;t have public metadata, but has a pointer to an endpoint that, provided authentication, will tell you some protected metadata, depending on who you authenticate as.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely something to watch for in the coming months.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mj-149x200.png" width="149" height="200" />Analytics firm comScore has just released its latest statistics for video streaming sites in the United States for the month of June, and at first glance the results are quite surprising: the top video sites have seen a major shakeup, with many of the top sites abruptly falling in the rankings.

The cause, of course, is the Michael Jackson effect — media organizations around the world dedicated huge amounts of coverage to the pop star's tragic death on June 25, and many people turned to the web to learn more.  Other breaking news that month, including the Iranian election controversy, also likely contributed to the growth seen by news properties.

<a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, which has ranked as the third most popular video site in the United States for the past few months, has dropped down to seventh.  Likewise, Fox Interactive Media, which includes <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, has dropped from second to fifth.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mj.png" class="shot2"/>Analytics firm comScore has just released its latest statistics for video streaming sites in the United States for the month of June, and at first glance the results are quite surprising: the top video sites have seen a major shakeup, with many of the top sites abruptly falling in the rankings.</p>
<p>The cause, of course, is the Michael Jackson effect — media organizations around the world dedicated huge amounts of coverage to the pop star&#8217;s tragic death on June 25, and many people turned to the web to learn more.  Other breaking news that month, including the Iranian election controversy, also likely contributed to the growth seen by news properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, which has ranked as the third most popular video site in the United States for the past few months, has dropped down to seventh.  Likewise, Fox Interactive Media, which includes <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, has dropped from second to fifth.</p>
<p>So who took their place?  Video search engine <a href="http://www.blinkx.com">Blinkx</a> jumped from sixth place in May with 300,641 views to fourth overall with over 623,000 (<b>Note:</b>all figures in 000&#8217;s).  Microsoft also saw a big jump, rising from fifth place in May with 310,560 overall streams, to third place in June, with 695,661 streams (much of this gain was likely due to increased traffic to MSN and MSNBC).  Turner, the parent company of CNN, also saw its video views nearly double.</p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s Viacom, the media conglomerate that includes Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and BET.  Viacom vaulted from seventh place in May with 281,368 views to second place in June, with a whopping 773,554.  Again, much of this can likely be attributed to the Michael Jackson news that was featured prominently on MTV, but Nickelodeon also saw strong traffic, which may be related to the summer season when kids generally watch more TV.</p>

The deal will be announced shortly after signing, and could come as early as today (Wednesday).</p>
<p>If the deal is completed it will close the 18-month long negotiation that began with a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/01/wow-microsoft-offers-446-billion-to-acquire-yahoo/">$45 billion merger offer</a> on February 1, 2008. The details of the deal will determine the bump in Yahoo&#8217;s share price, something <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=yahoo">investors</a> really desperately desire.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the deal may look like (from a Thomas Weisel Partners analyst report colorfully titled BingHoo! earlier this evening):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Deal (Finally) Inked:</strong> After a nearly three-year mating dance, Microsoft and Yahoo have agreed to a joint venture. The official announcement (hopefully with the financial implications) is expected tomorrow, July 29, the day before Microsoft’s annual analyst day.</p>
<p><strong>Bing becomes the algorithm:</strong> Importantly, Bing is expected to become the default search engine for Yahoo, as it has become across Microsoft’s network since its launch in June. By combining both companies’ engineering talent, search indexes and ad platforms, Microsoft believes it can improve its ability to drive innovation in emerging areas such as video, mobile, and online commerce; all areas where Google is currently focused. The combined Yahoo-Bing search would have 28% share in the U.S. according to comScore. But combining search indexes and reorganizing a global sales force across two companies is not a trivial matter and a distraction that Google can take advantage of. It is unclear what the cost savings would be to Yahoo. A year ago Yahoo management (headed by former CEO, Yang) indicated outsourcing all of search would yield a $750mn annual benefit. Given this deal covers only the algorithmic side and Yahoo has been cutting costs over the past year, we estimate the savings would be less than half that amount.</p>
<p><strong>Ad sales primarily owned by Yahoo:</strong> While details are still trickling out, it appears that Yahoo is slated to sell search inventory across both networks, capitalizing on Yahoo vertical strength in entertainment, finance and sports and Bing’s emerging strength in travel and retail. In addition Yahoo could gain the ability to sell display inventory across both networks along side search. The deal allows the parties to focus on core strengths: for Yahoo it’s selling and Microsoft it’s engineering.</p>
<p><strong>No Upfront Payment—Where’s that “boatload of cash?”:</strong> The reported deal does not include an upfront payment to Yahoo, a previous element of prior proposals, which may mute upside in Yahoo shares. Several critical details have yet to emerge: like the revenue share agreement and split levels, renewal terms of the partnership, cost savings and ultimate ownership of the data. For example, if the search deal is an 80/20 split, Yahoo would cede about $400mn of 2010 revenue to Microsoft. In addition, we estimate that Microsoft generates about $2bn in annual display revenue. If Yahoo got to sell half of that at an 80/20 split suggests Yahoo could see $200mn in incremental revenue.</p>
<p><strong>DoJ Scrutiny Risk:</strong> Importantly, the deal is likely to face a fair amount of interest from regulators regarding display advertising, which could delay the partnership by several months to several quarters.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is, no one expects any upfront payments to Yahoo. Revenue split estimates range from 80% - 110% to Yahoo (higher in the beginning), and there is likely a hefty guaranteed revenue component so assuage the Yahoo board of directors. </p>
<p>This is a much different search deal that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">Microsoft offered Yahoo a year ago</a>. From our summary of that long-dead offer:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Microsoft’s Last Offer</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft last offered Yahoo a combination stock, asset and business deal that sources with knowledge of the situation summarize as follows:</p>
<p>Microsoft to acquire 16% of Yahoo’s outstanding stock from existing stockholders for $8 billion, or $35/share.</p>
<p>Microsoft to acquire all of Yahoo’s search and search marketing assets - servers, code, advertisers, third party publishers, intellectual property and employees (perhaps 3,000 of them) for $1 billion in cash plus a guaranteed CPC rate that is higher than what Yahoo can generate itself.</p>
<p>Yahoo gets increased search revenue from the deal over what they generate now, and get to remove people and operational costs of search.</p>
<p>Yahoo agrees not to touch the search or search marketing businesses directly ever again. All their searches are controlled by Microsoft.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s also much different, and likely much less attractive, than the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/12/googleyahoo-announcement-at-130-this-afternoon/">Google/Yahoo search deal</a> announced last summer and which was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/05/google-pulls-the-plug-on-yahoo-advertising-deal/">terminated</a> before implementation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll analyze the actual deal terms as they are announced, but our guess is the likely outcome of this is one big complicated mess. The result: Google will take even more search share. Why these two companies don&#8217;t just merge is beyond me - everyone we&#8217;ve spoken with says everyone, on both sides of the table, would prefer a merger. Everyone, that is, except Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.</p>

1-800-FLOWERS is a bit of a pioneer when it comes to initiatives like this.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1-800-fb.png" class="shot2" />In another testament to the notion that <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> is quietly turning into the internet on top of the Internet, online flower retailer <a href="http://ww12.1800flowers.com/">1-800-Flowers.com</a> has launched an e-commerce store inside <a href="http://www.facebook.com/1800flowers?ref=search">its Facebook Page</a>. </p>

<p>1-800-FLOWERS is a bit of a pioneer when it comes to initiatives like this. In 1992 (!), the company was already fiddling with selling goods via the Internet, and two years later it became  the first merchant of any kind to transact on AOL. Now, at least according to the company, it&#8217;s the first online retailer to launch a fully functional commercial storefront inside Facebook. Somehow, I doubt that statement rings true, but I couldn&#8217;t immediately think of or find any other e-commerce outlets that can handle online orders from a to z inside Facebook.</p>
<p>Alas, when I did a search on Facebook for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php?q=1-800-flowers&#038;init=quick">&#8220;1-800-flowers&#8221;</a>, the very first result was a group unambiguously called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=10304716038&#038;ref=search">1-800-Flowers Sucks</a> and when I filtered down the results for Pages only the only result was one dubbed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/1-800-flowers-screwed-u-2/122315346872?ref=search">1-800-flowers-screwed-u-2?</a> (albeit with 0 fans). I finally found the official Facebook Page when I added &#8220;.com&#8221; to the search query, but at first sight it seems currently people are using social media more often against the company than vice versa.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what the company&#8217;s Facebook shop looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1-800.png" /></p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1-800-2.png" /></p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1-800-3.png" /></p>
<p>1-800-FLOWERS.COM has teamed up with ad network / app developer <a href="http://alvenda.com/">Alvenda</a> to bring its store to a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/facebooks-offical-user-count-now-250-million/">potentially massive audience</a> on Facebook (although only some 1530 people have become a fan of the florist shop&#8217;s Page so far). I&#8217;m told future versions of the store will integrate more robust social features, including birthday calendars and group gift giving options. </p>
<p>Currently, 1-800-FLOWERS accepts payment with all major credit cards, but it&#8217;s conceivable that it will be quick to implement Facebook&#8217;s upcoming <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/29/facebook-revs-up-for-payment-platform-with-updated-terms/">proprietary payment platform</a>, which is currently being <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/11/facebook-payment-platform-to-enter-testing-soon-only-7-months-late/">tested with a handful of developers</a>.</p>
<p>To conclude, a tip: when you become a fan of the retailer&#8217;s Facebook Page, you get a discount code. Happy flower shopping!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1212.png" width="210" height="96" />Live video monitoring systems are great — except for the fact that someone actually has to be watching for them to be of much use. Even if that doesn't mean watching it live, that means pouring over hours of footage that likely contains a lot of the same thing: Nothing. And that's why <a href="http://highlightcam.com/">HighlightCam</a> is cool. It condenses video down to just moments where there is actual activity.

It does this by watching for changes in video streams, which is to say that it looks for motion happening within the video. When it senses something, it knows to remember that portion of the video. And, if you set it up to do so, it can also send an email to you to let you know there is activity currently happening on the video stream. You can probably dream up a bunch of uses for something like this, but the obvious ones are monitoring babies from other room, watching your pets when you're away, and yes, watching to make sure no one is breaking into your house.]]></description>

<p>It does this by watching for changes in video streams, which is to say that it looks for motion happening within the video. When it senses something, it knows to remember that portion of the video. And, if you set it up to do so, it can also send an email to you to let you know there is activity currently happening on the video stream. You can probably dream up a bunch of uses for something like this, but the obvious ones are monitoring babies from other room, watching your pets when you&#8217;re away, and yes, watching to make sure no one is breaking into your house.</p>
<p>This sort of technology has only existed up until now in high-end security systems for big commercial buildings, we&#8217;re told. But HighlightCam does this at a fraction of the cost. To use it, you simply have to set up a webcam and then visit the HighlightCam site. The service is entirely browser-based. And you don&#8217;t even need an account to start using it (though you will need one to access recordings later).</p>
<p>If you want to see it in action, <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.tv</a> has been using it for their <a href="http://highlightcam.com/justin.tv/">pets section</a>, and it was a part of their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/justintv-opens-its-api-for-free-hopes-live-video-will-explode/">recent API launch</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>-funded HighlighCam makes use of the freemium model. With the free version you get the core features including the ability to use any webcam and e-mail notifications. But the main limitation is that your recorded videos are only stored for 24 hours. With the <a href="http://highlightcam.com/about/#premium">premium version</a> (which is $8.99 a month), videos are archived for 2 weeks, and you get higher resolution recordings, no ads on the site and the ability to download recorded videos.</p>
<p>I think we definitely need to set this up for the TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/crunchcam/">CrunchCam</a>. Most of the time when I&#8217;m not in the office and I tune in, I just see <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-kincaid">Jason</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/leena-rao">Leena</a> diligently typing away with absolutely no perceivable motion occuring. It&#8217;d be great to get an alert for the 15 minutes a day when there is actually something going on, like Segway jousting.</p>

They come from a new startup called <a href="http://LTLprints.com">Larger Than Life Prints</a>, which is best described as a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com">CafePress</a> or <a href="http://www.zazzle.com">Zazzle</a> for humongous stickers.  The company allows users to design their own oversized wall graphics, which can then be ordered in one-off runs or sold to other visitors through an integrated store.

The site is still fairly new, but's already beginning to attract some top talent, including <a href="http://www.ltlprints.com/susankare">Susan Kare</a>, who is famous for designing the on-screen graphics of the original Macintosh computer and many of Facebook's popular virtual gifts.

<p>The site is still fairly new, but&#8217;s already beginning to attract some top talent, including <a href="http://www.ltlprints.com/susankare">Susan Kare</a>, who is famous for designing the on-screen graphics of the original Macintosh computer and many of Facebook&#8217;s popular virtual gifts.  LTL Prints is featuring many of these artists in a collection of &#8216;<a href="http://www.ltlprints.com/start">big wall art</a>&#8216;, which includes art curated by the Start Soma Art Gallery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to really get excited about stickers, but these are actually pretty impressive.  They&#8217;re made out of a study fabric-based paper that&#8217;s really hard to tear (we tried), and it can also be applied many times on various surfaces, like walls and glass.   You can roll the sticker up in a ball, and it will pull apart without any lasting damage.  Contrast that with most other large stickers, which are typically made of vinyl, and it becomes clear that these are truly some high grade stickers.</p>
<p>Prices for the stickers range from $20 for a 2ft sticker to $165 for a massive 7 ft tall sticker.  From there you&#8217;re free to charge higher prices if you sell your sticker in the site&#8217;s integrated marketplace.<br />

So what does the guy who built the biggest site on the Internet from scratch do next? He raises a big pile of money, that's what.

We've confirmed that DeWolfe has been pitching a number of private equity funds to raise up to $100 million for a roll up of an Internet industry vertical. In exchange for confirmation we've agreed to keep exactly what that vertical is confidential for now. But at least two funds, both with significantly more than $1 billion to work with, are interested. DeWolfe, as is his style, won't comment on the fundraising.

It's not surprising that there is such strong interest. Few executives have been able to grow a company from zero to 1,700 employees and $800 million or so in revenue. In <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/24/myspacebook/">just five years</a>.

The design has been completely overhauled from the previous version which was fairly cluttered (see it at the bottom of the page). This new version is sleek and features trending topics by the minute, hour and day.

Most importantly, the new version features search functionality front and center. This way people who aren't even Twitter users yet can search for things being said on the service. And results are nicely placed on the same page below the main area.

You'll also notice that when you click on any of the popular topics, a description of why that topic is being featured appears along the top of the search results. This is something that is very helpful, as quite a few trending topics seem to make no sense on the surface. It looks like Twitter is using the third-party service <a href="http://www.whatthetrend.com/">What The Trend?</a> to populate these descriptions.]]></description>

<p>Most importantly, the new version features search functionality front and center. This way people who aren&#8217;t even Twitter users yet can search for things being said on the service. And results are nicely placed on the same page below the main area.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that when you click on any of the popular topics, a description of why that topic is being featured appears along the top of the search results. This is something that is very helpful, as quite a few trending topics seem to make no sense on the surface. It looks like Twitter is using the third-party service <a href="http://www.whatthetrend.com/">What The Trend?</a> to populate these descriptions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that nothing has changed about Twitter&#8217;s UI and functionality for those who are logged in. This is simply part of Twitter&#8217;s goal to make the service more accessible and obvious to new users, as well as increase engagement, and the use of search/trends. The bigger goal is to make it easier for businesses to use Twitter, which will allow the service to finally make some money. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/the-launch-of-twitter-101-step-one-of-the-business-plan-is-imminent/">new Twitter 101 area</a> is another of the initial steps in that direction.</p>
<p>Find screenshots below of both the new main page and the old version. As well as what the new main page search results look like.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: And <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/07/new-front-page.html">here&#8217;s Twitter&#8217;s post</a> on the new homepage. Here&#8217;s the key blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>The open and timely exchange of information will have a positive impact on the world and Twitter has a role to play. We have a lot of work to do when it comes to the quality of our search results and trend analysis but repositioning the product to focus more on discovery is an important first step in presenting Twitter to a wider audience of folks around the world who are eager to start engaging with new people, ideas, opinions, events, and sources of information.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely continue to make changes to the Twitter home page as we respond to feedback and ideas. We&#8217;re eager to see if encouraging a sense of wonder and discovery leads to a better first impression of Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: It also looks like Twitter is using this new homepage search interface to highlight some of the lesser-used search operators, like the &#8220;:)&#8221; symbol for results with &#8220;positive attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87797" title="picture-108" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-108-630x210.png" alt="picture-108" width="630" height="210" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87799" title="picture-1114" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1114-630x310.png" alt="picture-1114" width="630" height="310" /></p>
<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: As Adobe&#8217;s Ryan Stewart <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanstewart/status/2901744792">notes</a> on Twitter, this homepage change seems like it could be a fairly big shot across the bow of Google. After all, if everyone now visiting twitter.com sees search front and center, it&#8217;s pretty clear that the product is being positioned as a major player in the search game. It will be interesting to see Twitter&#8217;s next step, which undoubtedly will include another homepage redesign to match this new Twitter home screen. Will we also see the search box more prominently featured there?</p>

The benefits are obvious: unlike their platter-based counterparts, SSDs have no moving parts, and they&#8217;re also significantly faster for many tasks.  Unfortunately most software, both server-side and otherwise, has been optimized for the older drives and the physical limitations that come with them.  <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com">RethinkDB</a> is a new startup that&#8217;s looking to capitalize on this problem by building a storage engine for mySQL databases that&#8217;s fully optimized for SSD drives, bringing with it large speed boosts and a number of features sure to catch the eye of many developers.</p>
<p>The company, which is part of the latest batch of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>-funded startups, is in fairly early stages (it started developing the product only two months ago), but it&#8217;s already making some substantial headway in the features it can offer.  Among these are live schema changes, which allow developers to make significant modifications to their database structure without having to go through complex sync and backup procedures.  It also offers lock-free concurrency, which means users will be able to read from the database even while other users are writing to it.  And it&#8217;s an append-only database, which means developers can quickly recover in the event of a system failure.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rethinkdb.png"/></p>
<p>RethinkDB is also taking a relatively novel approach to its development, at least as far as database storage is concerned.  It&#8217;s following the &#8220;release early, release often&#8221; mantra, which it&#8217;s kicking off with the release of an early <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com/wiki/">developer pre-alpha</a>, which you can download and try out for free (the company says that implementing the software is quite easy because of the way MySQL handles storage engines).  However, given that you&#8217;re going to be using this to manage your data, it is absolutely vital that you use this for testing purposes only — make sure you have any crucial data stored elsewhere.  The company hopes to use developer input over the next few months to improve the product up until its release.  </p>
<p>RethinkDB plans to have its commercial product out the door in the next six months, with an enterprise-level pricing structure that charges on a per-CPU basis (with support included).</p>

TuneIn <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/10/tunein-a-media-dashboard-for-your-twitter-stream/">first launched</a> a couple of weeks ago at our RealTime CrunchUp. It's a web based Twitter client with a lot of additional features, including highlighting popular content from your network or anyone else you want to view. Lanzone has described it as "TiVo for Twitter" because it lets you peruse linked media and sites from your network.

The site has only rolled out initial features, Hertz tells me there is a lot more coming. Keep an eye on it.

Then a few weeks later it was an old-style high school yearbook avatar? (I preferred to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/parislemon/2782409329/">combine them</a>, killing two birds with one stone.) Well, get ready for another invasion: Mad Men avatars.</p>
<p>The television station AMC has set up a website, <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/madmenyourself/">MadMenYourself</a>, to allow users to create cartoon representations of how they might look if they were on the hit show, Mad Men. The results are quite good, and the avatars are already quickly spreading on Twitter.</p>
<p>The site takes an excruciatingly long time to load, but once it does, the process is fast. You start off selecting either a man or woman, choose a few attributes, pick you clothes and accessories. Then you get the option to download a full image complete with a backdrop that you might see on the show, a shot of just your full avatar (nice for Facebook or for an iPhone background), or just your face (perfect for Twitter).</p>
<p>Naturally, this is all just a promotion for the show, which starts its third season in a few weeks. But I&#8217;m all in favor of that because the show is awesome. Still, I give it about a month until we&#8217;re all sick of seeing these new avatars everywhere. At that point I may just yearbook my Mad Men avatar.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Microsoft had that contest where it would feature one user&#8217;s picture on Bing for an entire day — you know, the one I was mad about because you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/bing-wants-to-feature-your-best-summer-photo-—-no-keg-stands-please/">couldn&#8217;t submit keg stand pictures</a>.

<p>The winning image (below), was one of 9,400 picture submissions. You&#8217;d think out of all of those, users would have found a more perfect summer vacation image than a giant lightning storm, but whatever, it is a good picture.</p>
<p>The contest apparently attracted more than 13,000 unique voters. And the pictures garnered nearly 28,000 wall posts on the Facebook page. But the stat I&#8217;m really interested in is that there were over 10,000 submissions, and only 9,400 were accepted. I&#8217;d love to see those other 600+ pictures. Keg stands?</p>
<p>The image will be featured on Bing on August 3, for the entire day.</p>

Well, we never thought it would happen because of its intense rivalry with Google, but Facebook is almost ready to launch an official app for Android phones.  Hints are already <a href="http://androidandme.com/2009/07/news/official-facebook-app-finally-coming-to-android/">popping up </a> here and there, but I've been able to confirm it.  The app could hit the Android Market (its version of the App Store) as soon as the end of this week.  

Facebook's Android app will launch with a more limited set of features than its current, and very popular, iPhone app.  For instance, it won't have an inbox, I'm told by a source who has seen it.  But it will have the full Facebook stream, which is really all you need.  The Facebook Android app is built around the stream and status updates.  It was built with <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/facebook-opens-up-its-stream-api-to-developers/">Facebook's new Stream API</a>.  Your updates keep coming in, with a notification number telling you how many new items are available at any given time.  ]]></description>

<p>Well, we never thought it would happen because of its intense rivalry with Google, but Facebook is almost ready to launch an official app for Android phones.  Hints are already <a href="http://androidandme.com/2009/07/news/official-facebook-app-finally-coming-to-android/">popping up </a> here and there, but I&#8217;ve been able to confirm it.  The app could hit the Android Market (its version of the App Store) as soon as the end of this week.  </p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Android app will launch with a more limited set of features than its current, and very popular, iPhone app.  For instance, it won&#8217;t have an inbox, I&#8217;m told by a source who has seen it.  But it will have the full Facebook stream, which is really all you need.  The Facebook Android app is built around the stream and status updates.  It was built with <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/facebook-opens-up-its-stream-api-to-developers/">Facebook&#8217;s new Stream API</a>.  Your updates keep coming in, with a notification number telling you how many new items are available at any given time.  </p>
<p>As recently as last October, Facebook had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/22/dont-hold-your-breathe-for-the-facebook-android-app/">no interest</a> in building an Android app. Why help its arch-rival Google?  Back then, Michael wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>From what we hear, Facebook has dedicated exactly zero resources to creating a version of the service for Android, and has no plans to launch anything at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what changed?  Well, for one thing, Android is now on the verge of becoming a serious competitor to the iPhone, with nearly two dozen new phones set to launch this year. For another thing, the Android team at Google offered to help, and even loaned Facebook an Android engineer.  Facebook still doesn&#8217;t have one of its own, says my source.  (Facebook wouldn&#8217;t comment).  Some Google engineers are already using the app like crazy.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are still waiting for the next version of Facebook&#8217;s iPhone app, which will include events, video uploading, and so <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/details-on-the-upcoming-new-facebook-iphone-app-now-with-events/">much more.</a>  The current app, which many social networking junkies find <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/facebooks-iphone-app-almost-replaces-my-contacts-list/">indispensable</a>, launched a year ago.</p>

Left by &#8220;J&#8221; on MG&#8217;s latest <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">iPhone rant</a> about the Google Voice debacle. Beautiful.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You want answers?</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: We think we’re entitled to them.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You want answers?!</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: We want Google Voice on our iPhones.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You can’t handle the iPhone with Google Voice!</p>
<p>Son, we operate on network that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by carriers with restrictions. Who’s gonna do it? You? You, Verizon Wireless? We have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Google Voice and you curse AT&amp;T. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what we know: That pulling Google Voice, while tragic, probably saved the network. And our existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves the network.</p>
<p>You don’t want the Google Voice on your iPhone. Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at TechCrunch50, you want us protecting the network. You need us protecting that network. We use words like rate limiting, application approval and restrictions…we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline.</p>
<p>We have neither the time nor the inclination to explain ourselves to a blog who writes and profits under the blanket of the very network that we provide, then questions the manner in which we provide it. We’d prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, we suggest you pick up a router and build your own network. Either way, We don’t give a damn what you think you’re entitled to.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: Did you order Google Voice taken down?</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: We did the job you sent us to do.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: Did you order Google Voice taken down?</p>
<p><strong>AT&#038;T</strong>: You’re goddamn right we did.</p></blockquote>

The latest issue involves the story we covered yesterday about apps using the Google Voice service <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">getting pulled</a> from Apple's App Store. In <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">a follow-up post</a>, we didn't exactly go out on a limb suggesting that it was AT&#38;T and not Apple, that was responsible for the app being pulled. After all, word is that Apple VP Phil Schiller personally ushered one of those apps, GV Mobile, through the approval process initially. And today brings word that the apps were indeed removed at AT&#38;T's request. Daring Fireball's John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-app-store">cites</a> a "reliable little birdie" on the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-om-iphone">news</a>, and we've just heard the same thing from a source as well.

While <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">some</a> found it very hard to believe that AT&#38;T would be the ones behind something like this, given that it allows Google Voice apps on other phones on its network, those kind of contradictions are nothing new when it comes to AT&#38;T with the iPhone. It's the same contradiction that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/a-consumer-iphone-app-that-boldly-goes-beyond-the-999-threshold/">prevents the SlingPlayer iPhone app</a> from working on AT&#38;T's network, while it works just fine on other AT&#38;T devices. And the same one that is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">cripple a Hulu app</a>, if it ever gets released.]]></description>

<p>The latest issue involves the story we covered yesterday about apps using the Google Voice service <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">getting pulled</a> from Apple&#8217;s App Store. In <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">a follow-up post</a>, we didn&#8217;t exactly go out on a limb suggesting that it was AT&amp;T and not Apple, that was responsible for the app being pulled.

<p>While <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">some</a> found it very hard to believe that AT&amp;T would be the ones behind something like this, given that it allows Google Voice apps on other phones on its network, those kind of contradictions are nothing new when it comes to AT&amp;T with the iPhone.

And the same one that is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">cripple a Hulu app</a>, if it ever gets released.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that iPhone users consume a lot more data than other smartphone users, and so all of this seems to be a case of AT&amp;T getting more than it bargained for when it signed the exclusive deal to be the iPhone carrier in the U.S. And while you might think that it would be a nice problem to have, a number of sources have indicated to us that the iPhone&#8217;s rapid growth is what is responsible for AT&amp;T&#8217;s network degradation over the past several months, particularly in places like San Francisco, where iPhone usage is very high.</p>
<p>Now just imagine the service nightmares if AT&amp;T permitted high-use/high-bandwidth services on the device. While it has been laughably slow to roll out its official tethering option for the iPhone, I shudder to think of what it will do to the network when it does become available later this year. Of course, AT&amp;T is expected to charge and arm and a leg for the option, in a move that is undoubtedly, at least in part, to limit the number of users who will sign up.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what it has come to for AT&amp;T with regards to the iPhone: Restrictions, restrictions, restrictions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87468" title="code_red" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/code_red.jpg" alt="code_red" width="320" height="240" />AT&amp;T is constantly promising that network upgrades are coming, but Apple keeps selling more and more iPhones. While it would never admit it, I think it&#8217;s beyond time to wonder if AT&amp;T can handle the exclusive iPhone partnership anymore. I&#8217;m not saying that the situation would be different had it been Verizon who got the exclusive deal, I&#8217;m simply stating what is on everyone&#8217;s mind: AT&amp;T is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">simply not working</a> the way it should be for customers who are paying close to, or in excess of, $100 a month.</p>
<p>Certainly, losing the exclusivity would hurt the company&#8217;s bottom line, and would hit the customer base pretty hard, but losing the iPhone exclusivity may end up being a good thing for AT&amp;T. Good in that it&#8217;s network may finally work again.</p>
<p>Of course, AT&amp;T is said to be working hard to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/shocker-att-wants-to-keep-keep-sitting-on-its-golden-egg-the-iphone/">extend the exclusive deal</a> with Apple beyond next year. But that will be a nightmare for everyone involved. We have no shortage of sources, some very close to Apple, now telling us that as mad as all of us (the customers) are with AT&amp;T, Apple is just as mad, if not more so. Apple can speak in platitudes all it wants during earnings calls about its partnership with AT&amp;T — behind the scenes, trust me, they hear our complaints loud and clear.</p>
<p>But the one hot new wireless partner that is always mentioned, Verizon (since it is the biggest network and generally considered to be more reliable), looks like it is still playing hardball. This morning it officially announced that it would be getting the Palm Pre in early 2010, and it&#8217;s playing up its RIM partnership and its own app store. That&#8217;s what you call leverage in negotiating with Apple, which it is.</p>
<p>Still, even the iPhone on another, smaller GSM carrier, like T-Mobile, would undoubtedly help ease some of the strain on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network. Again, AT&amp;T would never admit it, but the era of iPhone exclusivity may have to be ended over sheer strain. And when that happens, we may just see AT&amp;T approving of Google Voice apps and SlingPlayer apps on the iPhone again. AT&amp;T has painted itself into a corner, and it&#8217;s fighting hard to keep itself there, but it&#8217;s simply not a viable option anymore for any of the parties involved (Apple, the customers, and even AT&amp;T).</p>
<p>When I asked for a comment from AT&amp;T on this latest fiasco, here&#8217;s what I got:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nope – Apple is the one who can talk about their App Store.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would seem to suggest that AT&amp;T is saying Apple is in complete <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/28/what-steve-said-about-the-app-store-and-why-we-need-to-suck-it-up/">control</a> over all of this. But we know that&#8217;s simply not the case. Is AT&amp;T in denial? No, I think that they think we just can&#8217;t handle the truth. And I think that truth is that they can&#8217;t handle the iPhone, anymore.</p>

The problem at SoftLayer was resolved, but some users of <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>, a DNS service provider that is becoming <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/sequoia-opendns-greylock/">more and more popular</a>, still can't reach those websites. The reason? OpenDNS caches IP addresses for domain names on a user's computer, and they've cached a bunch of bad DNS entries now on these computers. This speeds up web surfing considerably, and has helped some users <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/12/lose-your-time.html">avoid</a> major outages at the ISP level in the past. But in cases like today, with outages at the hosting level, the bad IP information ends up being cached for up to a day.

Users who know what's going on can reboot their computers to clear the cache, but that's clearly not a good overall solution.

<p>The problem at SoftLayer was resolved, but some users of <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>, a DNS service provider that is becoming <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/sequoia-opendns-greylock/">more and more popular</a>, still can&#8217;t reach those websites. The reason? OpenDNS caches IP addresses for domain names on a user&#8217;s computer, and they&#8217;ve cached a bunch of bad DNS entries now on these computers. This speeds up web surfing considerably, and has helped some users <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/12/lose-your-time.html">avoid</a> major outages at the ISP level in the past. But in cases like today, with outages at the hosting level, the bad IP information ends up being cached for up to a day.</p>
<p>Users who know what&#8217;s going on can reboot their computers to clear the cache, but that&#8217;s clearly not a good overall solution. OpenDNS says they are turning on a feature called SmartCache that caches both the current and &#8220;last good&#8221; IP address, so situations like today won&#8217;t be an issue any longer.</p>

<a HREF="http://technologizer.com/2009/07/28/hey-iphone-are-you-a-computer-or-a-phone/">Harry "Long Tail" McCracken</a> remembers what Steve said way back in the old days about the App Store. 

<blockquote>Jobs said that Apple wouldn’t distribute porn or malicious apps or privacy-invading apps, and said that Apple’s interests and those of third-party developers were the same. The slide also mentioned “Bandwidth hogs,” which apparently meant stuff like SlingPlayer, and “Unforseen,” which I assumed at the time referred to other applications that put iPhone owners at risk in one way or another. What he didn’t do is say that Apple would reject software that competed with Apple or AT&#038;T offerings.</blockquote>

This "unforeseen" section is what really bugs everyone. Google Voice, for example, could feasibly recreate some basic iPhone functionality and also act as a resource hog. ]]></description>

Every company he's worked for has been acquired, and the smallest deal was $265 million.

Lin dropped out of a PhD program at Stanford to join LinkExchange in 1996 as acting CFO. Two years later the company was <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-acquires-LinkExchange/2100-1033_3-217516.html">acquired</a> by Microsoft for $265 million in stock. He then cofounded Venture Frogs, a $27 million venture fund, with college buddy <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tony-hsieh">Tony Hsieh</a>. Investments included Zappos, TellMe, OpenTable, MyAble, Mongo Music and Ask Jeeves, all of which have been acquired or went public.

Lin then joined <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/tellme">TellMe</a> in 2001 as VP Finance and Business Development. At the time he joined the company was losing $60 million per year, he tells me. Microsoft bought the company for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/14/microsoft-acquires-tellme/">$800 million</a> in 2007.

Then he really outdid himself. He joined <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zappos">Zappos</a>, reuniting with his old friend Hsieh, in 2006 as COO and CFO. How'd they do? Yeah, they were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/">acquired last week by Amazon</a> for close to $1 billion.]]></description>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if Lin is the master operator (his former colleagues and venture capitalists all say glowing things) or if he&#8217;s just really, really good at picking winners. But one thing is clear - this guy has the Midas Touch. I highly recommend interviewing at whatever company he ends up at next. It&#8217;s likely to be a big winner.</p>

<p>Google is finally figuring out that short links are just easier to deal with, especially on a mobile phone.  No, it is not rolling out its own URL shortening service just yet (<a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly,</a> stand down).  But today it is <a href=" http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/07/iterative-web-app-links-got-shorter-and.html">introducing</a> what it calls &#8220;smart links&#8221; to the mobile version of Gmail.  </p>
<p>When it recognizes a super-long link like the one for Google Maps shown above right, it will shorten it to the underlying name thing being linked to.  In this case, it is an address (below right)</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/smartlink2.png"/ class="shot2"/></p>
<p>Basically, it translates the URL into English.  Gmail&#8217;s smart links also work for direction destinations on Google Maps, and the names of YouTube videos and Google Sites pages.  It is starting with Google-owned properties, where it knows the underlying names.  But it doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to those. </p>
<p>It seems like a good idea and one which could be expanded to other links across the Web, including news headlines, image titles, Tweets, and countless other things.  I kind of wish I could enable this feature in regular Gmail as well.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/yahoo_microsoft-215x138.png" width="215" height="138" />The much anticipated <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/microsoftyahoo-search-today-not-so-fast/">Microsoft/Yahoo search alliance</a> is in the "final stages of negotiation" says a source close to Yahoo, and may be signed at any time. The two companies have been negotiating the terms of the transaction for weeks, and our source says that the deal guys are largely out of the process now. The lawyers are negotiating the final details.

That doesn't mean the deal is guaranteed, of course. But everything we're hearing says it's highly likely. The deal will be announced publicly shortly after it's signed, and could come "today, tomorrow, next week" according to our source.

Most of the negotiations have been over an up front payment to Yahoo, speculated to be in the $500 million - $1 billion range. The size and specifics of the up front payment have been a sticking point, including whether it is a simple payment for the deal or a guarantee on future revenues. We have no additional information on where the two companies ended up on that deal term.

Both companies announced less than stellar quarterly earnings last week. Yahoo revenues were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/yahoos-revenues-drop-13-percent-in-second-quarter-announces-5-percent-of-employees-to-lose-jobs/">down 13%</a>, and Microsoft had its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/microsofts-money-pit-every-dollar-of-online-revenue-is-wiped-out-by-a-dollar-of-loss/">own woes to deal with</a>. ]]></description>

That means developers and designers can henceforth tap into the Issuu platform and services to equip their own applications and websites with the oft-needed functionality of offering document consultation without the need for end users to download the docs or to visit the Issuu website.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="shot2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/issuu.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://www.issuu.com/">Issuu</a>, the Danish startup battling the likes of <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/">Docstoc</a> and <a href="http://scribd.com/">Scribd</a> in the professional document publication and sharing space, is today introducing a <a href="http://issuu.com/api/">REST-based API</a> that enables its users to automatically upload and manage publications, bookmarks, and folders under their accounts. </p>
<p>That means developers and designers can henceforth tap into the Issuu platform and services to equip their own applications and websites with the oft-needed functionality of offering document consultation without the need for end users to download the docs or to visit the Issuu website. Issuu already offered two APIs: one for Search (which allows developers to sift through all Issuu publications, comments, and users) and one for its Viewer product. It is now adding a third one for the &#8216;Upload&#8217; feature, obviously an essential one.</p>
<p>When Docstoc recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/13/docstoc-charges-out-of-beta-with-doccash-apis-and-more-blog-like-homepage/">left the beta phase</a>, it also launched with a number of <a href="http://platform.docstoc.com/">open APIs</a>. I&#8217;d check up on Scribd too, but their website is currently down.</p>
<p>Either way, we like Issuu here at TechCrunch. When the company first launched, it was one of the first services of its kind whose <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/19/issuu-really-wants-to-kill-the-document-download/">interface and functionality</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/06/finally-a-web-based-pdf-viewer-that-does-not-suck-issuu/">didn’t suck</a>. The startup has been busy <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/issuu-adds-new-features-in-the-race-to-catch-up-to-scribd/">adding new features</a> to its products and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/28/issuu-gets-5-million-infusion-adds-features-and-premium-version">venture capital to its bank account</a> - it raised a total of $6.25 million in funding to date - and is seeing decent traction as well. </p>
<p>According to co-founder Martin Ferro-Thomsen, Issuu currently services over 325 million monthly unique page views across its entire network of publishers (including embeds in articles etc.) and welcomes 4.4 million unique visitors to its main website Issuu.com every month.</p>

<em>The following message is brought to you by TechCrunch50 co-host <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a>.</em>

In order to build excitement for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/blog/">TechCrunch50 conference</a> we've convinced the bean counters at TechCrunch HQ to let us give away one $2,500 ticket a day for the next 45 days. That's more than $100,000 worth of TechCrunch50 tickets.

So, if you're broke, laid off or too cheap to buy a ticket, all you have to do is hit your followers with the hashtag #techcrunch50 at the end of each tweet. Every Tweet you send out is another chance to win the ticket being given away that day.

Every day we will pick one of the tweets from the previous day with the #techcrunch50 hashtag at random.

<p>Every day we will pick one of the tweets from the previous day with the #techcrunch50 hashtag at random.</p>
<p>Some rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tweets should be relevant to startups, entrepreneurism or the the conference itself.</li>
<li> If you do something insane like create 20 accounts and spam twitter with 1,000 tweets a second we&#8217;ll bounce you from the drawing (and they will turn off your account!).</li>
<li>You can only win one ticket.</li>
<li>We will announce the previous day&#8217;s winner each day at noon pacific or thereabouts on the <a href="http://twitter.com/techcrunch50">@techcrunch50</a> twitter account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck and we appreciate your support in this attempt to leverage social media to promote the conference. <img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />

			<title>Blubet Bets That You Want To Predict Things On Twitter</title>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-166.png" width="174" height="64" />There are 1.2 million predictions made on Twitter everyday. Those are numbers that the prediction startup <a href="http://blubet.com">Blubet</a> pulled 2 weeks ago from the service. That's roughly 5% to 6% of the overall tweets being sent out on any given day, according to their data. So it's really not surprising that Blubet would want to build its business around this platform.

That wasn't always the case. When the company started on the idea of Blubet a couple years ago, as an offshoot of the community gaming site <a href="http://www.dotblu.com/default.aspx">dotblu</a>, the idea was that it would be more of a traditional site. But then Twitter exploded in popularity, and Blubet knew that it simply couldn't ignore the expanding social graph and platform that Twitter offers. So now Blubet is entirely built on top of Twitter. It has its own separate site, but for the site to work as it's intended, you have to tweet out predictions you make on the site, and get others to participate.

Of course, you can also do this from Twitter, using hashtags or DMs. But the preferred method is to visit the site and fill out a prediction. From there you can assign a value to the prediction which you will win (or lose) depending on how your bet does. And you can also see friend's predictions and give them a "yes" or "no" comment based on if you think they will come true or not.]]></description>

Those are numbers that the prediction startup <a href="http://blubet.com">Blubet</a> pulled 2 weeks ago from the service. That&#8217;s roughly 5% to 6% of the overall tweets being sent out on any given day, according to their data. So it&#8217;s really not surprising that Blubet would want to build its business around this platform.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t always the case. When the company started on the idea of Blubet a couple years ago, as an offshoot of the community gaming site <a href="http://www.dotblu.com/default.aspx">dotblu</a>, the idea was that it would be more of a traditional site. But then Twitter exploded in popularity, and Blubet knew that it simply couldn&#8217;t ignore the expanding social graph and platform that Twitter offers. So now Blubet is entirely built on top of Twitter. It has its own separate site, but for the site to work as it&#8217;s intended, you have to tweet out predictions you make on the site, and get others to participate.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also do this from Twitter, using hashtags or DMs. But the preferred method is to visit the site and fill out a prediction. From there you can assign a value to the prediction which you will win (or lose) depending on how your bet does. And you can also see friend&#8217;s predictions and give them a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; comment based on if you think they will come true or not.</p>
<p>The idea here should be fairly obvious: This is all about social gaming. But unlike past social gaming Twitter <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/spymaster-the-twitter-game-that-will-assassinate-your-time/">services like Spymaster</a>, Blubet is being very cautious about what data it sends back to Twitter. For example, it prompts you before you sent a tweet back (which will include a link back to Blubet). If you opt to allow the tweet to go out, that setting will be remembered in the future (but you can always change it). But a key difference with the previous viral games of Twitter is that Blubet does not send DMs to your friends without your knowledge. And it does not currently allow for follow-up comments on prediction posts to get sent back to Twitter (though the site is thinking about that).</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87298" title="752359031_e6e2cb5d3e" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/752359031_e6e2cb5d3e.jpg" alt="752359031_e6e2cb5d3e" width="225" height="350" />If you make a prediction on Blubet, and it comes true, you get the number of points you wagered. If you get enough of these points, you level up. And there is a leader board to determine who is doing the best with their predictions. Right now, it&#8217;s run on a honor system, with other users charged with reporting a user if they&#8217;re lying about a prediction made.</p>
<p>And while these points don&#8217;t exactly translate into real-world currency (something which is a very gray area), there is a chance to use small transactions to get more points in the game. For example, if you pay $5, you get 1,000 ponits. $5 gets you 5,500 points. And $10 gets you 11,000 points. Obviously, this is step one for how the company plans to make money. But there are other plans too, including sponsor-created bets and intelligent automated bet creations.</p>
<p>Blubet founder and CEO Song Kim expects that sports and entertainment will eventually be the two dominant Twitter betting categories. That rings true. Tweeting about a game is one thing, but tweeting about how you think is going to win a game with points on the line, is another game entirely.</p>
<p>Blubet has raised $3.6 million in funding to date. The last round (its series A) came a few months ago led by D.E. Shaw. There is also an impressive roster of people who have invested in the past including Bebo founder Michael Birch and VCs Ron Conway and Jeff Clavier. Kim notes that the company has a low burn rate, and this money should last them a while.</p>
<p>While there are other startups in the prediction space on the web, notably <a href="http://www.hubdub.com/">Hubdub</a>, Blubet believes it&#8217;s the first to tackle the issue solely on Twitter. And given the 1.2 million prediction number, it seems like a good place to start.</p>
<p>There are also plans to integrate SMS service soon, and plans for both mobile web and apps for platforms likes the iPhone, in the future. Blubet currently consists of 7 employees.</p>

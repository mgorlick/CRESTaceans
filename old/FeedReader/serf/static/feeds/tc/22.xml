Left by &#8220;J&#8221; on MG&#8217;s latest <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">iPhone rant</a> about the Google Voice debacle. Beautiful.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You want answers?</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: We think we’re entitled to them.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You want answers?!</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: We want Google Voice on our iPhones.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: You can’t handle the iPhone with Google Voice!</p>
<p>Son, we operate on network that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by carriers with restrictions. Who’s gonna do it? You? You, Verizon Wireless? We have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Google Voice and you curse AT&amp;T. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what we know: That pulling Google Voice, while tragic, probably saved the network. And our existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves the network.</p>
<p>You don’t want the Google Voice on your iPhone. Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at TechCrunch50, you want us protecting the network. You need us protecting that network. We use words like rate limiting, application approval and restrictions…we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline.</p>
<p>We have neither the time nor the inclination to explain ourselves to a blog who writes and profits under the blanket of the very network that we provide, then questions the manner in which we provide it. We’d prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, we suggest you pick up a router and build your own network. Either way, We don’t give a damn what you think you’re entitled to.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: Did you order Google Voice taken down?</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>: We did the job you sent us to do.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch</strong>: Did you order Google Voice taken down?</p>
<p><strong>AT&#038;T</strong>: You’re goddamn right we did.</p></blockquote>

The latest issue involves the story we covered yesterday about apps using the Google Voice service <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">getting pulled</a> from Apple's App Store. In <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">a follow-up post</a>, we didn't exactly go out on a limb suggesting that it was AT&#38;T and not Apple, that was responsible for the app being pulled. After all, word is that Apple VP Phil Schiller personally ushered one of those apps, GV Mobile, through the approval process initially. And today brings word that the apps were indeed removed at AT&#38;T's request. Daring Fireball's John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-app-store">cites</a> a "reliable little birdie" on the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-om-iphone">news</a>, and we've just heard the same thing from a source as well.

While <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">some</a> found it very hard to believe that AT&#38;T would be the ones behind something like this, given that it allows Google Voice apps on other phones on its network, those kind of contradictions are nothing new when it comes to AT&#38;T with the iPhone. It's the same contradiction that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/a-consumer-iphone-app-that-boldly-goes-beyond-the-999-threshold/">prevents the SlingPlayer iPhone app</a> from working on AT&#38;T's network, while it works just fine on other AT&#38;T devices. And the same one that is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">cripple a Hulu app</a>, if it ever gets released.]]></description>

<p>While <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">some</a> found it very hard to believe that AT&amp;T would be the ones behind something like this, given that it allows Google Voice apps on other phones on its network, those kind of contradictions are nothing new when it comes to AT&amp;T with the iPhone.

And the same one that is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">cripple a Hulu app</a>, if it ever gets released.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that iPhone users consume a lot more data than other smartphone users, and so all of this seems to be a case of AT&amp;T getting more than it bargained for when it signed the exclusive deal to be the iPhone carrier in the U.S. And while you might think that it would be a nice problem to have, a number of sources have indicated to us that the iPhone&#8217;s rapid growth is what is responsible for AT&amp;T&#8217;s network degradation over the past several months, particularly in places like San Francisco, where iPhone usage is very high.</p>
<p>Now just imagine the service nightmares if AT&amp;T permitted high-use/high-bandwidth services on the device. While it has been laughably slow to roll out its official tethering option for the iPhone, I shudder to think of what it will do to the network when it does become available later this year. Of course, AT&amp;T is expected to charge and arm and a leg for the option, in a move that is undoubtedly, at least in part, to limit the number of users who will sign up.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what it has come to for AT&amp;T with regards to the iPhone: Restrictions, restrictions, restrictions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87468" title="code_red" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/code_red.jpg" alt="code_red" width="320" height="240" />AT&amp;T is constantly promising that network upgrades are coming, but Apple keeps selling more and more iPhones. While it would never admit it, I think it&#8217;s beyond time to wonder if AT&amp;T can handle the exclusive iPhone partnership anymore. I&#8217;m not saying that the situation would be different had it been Verizon who got the exclusive deal, I&#8217;m simply stating what is on everyone&#8217;s mind: AT&amp;T is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">simply not working</a> the way it should be for customers who are paying close to, or in excess of, $100 a month.</p>
<p>Certainly, losing the exclusivity would hurt the company&#8217;s bottom line, and would hit the customer base pretty hard, but losing the iPhone exclusivity may end up being a good thing for AT&amp;T. Good in that it&#8217;s network may finally work again.</p>
<p>Of course, AT&amp;T is said to be working hard to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/shocker-att-wants-to-keep-keep-sitting-on-its-golden-egg-the-iphone/">extend the exclusive deal</a> with Apple beyond next year. But that will be a nightmare for everyone involved. We have no shortage of sources, some very close to Apple, now telling us that as mad as all of us (the customers) are with AT&amp;T, Apple is just as mad, if not more so. Apple can speak in platitudes all it wants during earnings calls about its partnership with AT&amp;T — behind the scenes, trust me, they hear our complaints loud and clear.</p>
<p>But the one hot new wireless partner that is always mentioned, Verizon (since it is the biggest network and generally considered to be more reliable), looks like it is still playing hardball. This morning it officially announced that it would be getting the Palm Pre in early 2010, and it&#8217;s playing up its RIM partnership and its own app store. That&#8217;s what you call leverage in negotiating with Apple, which it is.</p>
<p>Still, even the iPhone on another, smaller GSM carrier, like T-Mobile, would undoubtedly help ease some of the strain on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network. Again, AT&amp;T would never admit it, but the era of iPhone exclusivity may have to be ended over sheer strain. And when that happens, we may just see AT&amp;T approving of Google Voice apps and SlingPlayer apps on the iPhone again. AT&amp;T has painted itself into a corner, and it&#8217;s fighting hard to keep itself there, but it&#8217;s simply not a viable option anymore for any of the parties involved (Apple, the customers, and even AT&amp;T).</p>
<p>When I asked for a comment from AT&amp;T on this latest fiasco, here&#8217;s what I got:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nope – Apple is the one who can talk about their App Store.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would seem to suggest that AT&amp;T is saying Apple is in complete <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/28/what-steve-said-about-the-app-store-and-why-we-need-to-suck-it-up/">control</a> over all of this. But we know that&#8217;s simply not the case. Is AT&amp;T in denial? No, I think that they think we just can&#8217;t handle the truth. And I think that truth is that they can&#8217;t handle the iPhone, anymore.</p>

Users who know what's going on can reboot their computers to clear the cache, but that's clearly not a good overall solution.

<a HREF="http://technologizer.com/2009/07/28/hey-iphone-are-you-a-computer-or-a-phone/">Harry "Long Tail" McCracken</a> remembers what Steve said way back in the old days about the App Store. 

<blockquote>Jobs said that Apple wouldn’t distribute porn or malicious apps or privacy-invading apps, and said that Apple’s interests and those of third-party developers were the same. The slide also mentioned “Bandwidth hogs,” which apparently meant stuff like SlingPlayer, and “Unforseen,” which I assumed at the time referred to other applications that put iPhone owners at risk in one way or another. What he didn’t do is say that Apple would reject software that competed with Apple or AT&#038;T offerings.</blockquote>

This "unforeseen" section is what really bugs everyone. Google Voice, for example, could feasibly recreate some basic iPhone functionality and also act as a resource hog. ]]></description>

Every company he's worked for has been acquired, and the smallest deal was $265 million.

Lin dropped out of a PhD program at Stanford to join LinkExchange in 1996 as acting CFO. Two years later the company was <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-acquires-LinkExchange/2100-1033_3-217516.html">acquired</a> by Microsoft for $265 million in stock. He then cofounded Venture Frogs, a $27 million venture fund, with college buddy <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tony-hsieh">Tony Hsieh</a>. Investments included Zappos, TellMe, OpenTable, MyAble, Mongo Music and Ask Jeeves, all of which have been acquired or went public.

Lin then joined <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/tellme">TellMe</a> in 2001 as VP Finance and Business Development. At the time he joined the company was losing $60 million per year, he tells me. Microsoft bought the company for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/14/microsoft-acquires-tellme/">$800 million</a> in 2007.

Then he really outdid himself. He joined <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zappos">Zappos</a>, reuniting with his old friend Hsieh, in 2006 as COO and CFO. How'd they do? Yeah, they were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/">acquired last week by Amazon</a> for close to $1 billion.]]></description>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if Lin is the master operator (his former colleagues and venture capitalists all say glowing things) or if he&#8217;s just really, really good at picking winners. But one thing is clear - this guy has the Midas Touch. I highly recommend interviewing at whatever company he ends up at next. It&#8217;s likely to be a big winner.</p>

<p>Google is finally figuring out that short links are just easier to deal with, especially on a mobile phone.  No, it is not rolling out its own URL shortening service just yet (<a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly,</a> stand down).  But today it is <a href=" http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/07/iterative-web-app-links-got-shorter-and.html">introducing</a> what it calls &#8220;smart links&#8221; to the mobile version of Gmail.  </p>
<p>When it recognizes a super-long link like the one for Google Maps shown above right, it will shorten it to the underlying name thing being linked to.  In this case, it is an address (below right)</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/smartlink2.png"/ class="shot2"/></p>
<p>Basically, it translates the URL into English.  Gmail&#8217;s smart links also work for direction destinations on Google Maps, and the names of YouTube videos and Google Sites pages.  It is starting with Google-owned properties, where it knows the underlying names.  But it doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to those. </p>
<p>It seems like a good idea and one which could be expanded to other links across the Web, including news headlines, image titles, Tweets, and countless other things.  I kind of wish I could enable this feature in regular Gmail as well.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/yahoo_microsoft-215x138.png" width="215" height="138" />The much anticipated <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/microsoftyahoo-search-today-not-so-fast/">Microsoft/Yahoo search alliance</a> is in the "final stages of negotiation" says a source close to Yahoo, and may be signed at any time. The two companies have been negotiating the terms of the transaction for weeks, and our source says that the deal guys are largely out of the process now. The lawyers are negotiating the final details.

That doesn't mean the deal is guaranteed, of course. But everything we're hearing says it's highly likely. The deal will be announced publicly shortly after it's signed, and could come "today, tomorrow, next week" according to our source.

Most of the negotiations have been over an up front payment to Yahoo, speculated to be in the $500 million - $1 billion range. The size and specifics of the up front payment have been a sticking point, including whether it is a simple payment for the deal or a guarantee on future revenues. We have no additional information on where the two companies ended up on that deal term.

Both companies announced less than stellar quarterly earnings last week. Yahoo revenues were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/yahoos-revenues-drop-13-percent-in-second-quarter-announces-5-percent-of-employees-to-lose-jobs/">down 13%</a>, and Microsoft had its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/microsofts-money-pit-every-dollar-of-online-revenue-is-wiped-out-by-a-dollar-of-loss/">own woes to deal with</a>. ]]></description>

<p>That means developers and designers can henceforth tap into the Issuu platform and services to equip their own applications and websites with the oft-needed functionality of offering document consultation without the need for end users to download the docs or to visit the Issuu website. Issuu already offered two APIs: one for Search (which allows developers to sift through all Issuu publications, comments, and users) and one for its Viewer product. It is now adding a third one for the &#8216;Upload&#8217; feature, obviously an essential one.</p>
<p>When Docstoc recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/13/docstoc-charges-out-of-beta-with-doccash-apis-and-more-blog-like-homepage/">left the beta phase</a>, it also launched with a number of <a href="http://platform.docstoc.com/">open APIs</a>. I&#8217;d check up on Scribd too, but their website is currently down.</p>
<p>Either way, we like Issuu here at TechCrunch. When the company first launched, it was one of the first services of its kind whose <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/19/issuu-really-wants-to-kill-the-document-download/">interface and functionality</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/06/finally-a-web-based-pdf-viewer-that-does-not-suck-issuu/">didn’t suck</a>. The startup has been busy <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/issuu-adds-new-features-in-the-race-to-catch-up-to-scribd/">adding new features</a> to its products and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/28/issuu-gets-5-million-infusion-adds-features-and-premium-version">venture capital to its bank account</a> - it raised a total of $6.25 million in funding to date - and is seeing decent traction as well. </p>
<p>According to co-founder Martin Ferro-Thomsen, Issuu currently services over 325 million monthly unique page views across its entire network of publishers (including embeds in articles etc.) and welcomes 4.4 million unique visitors to its main website Issuu.com every month.</p>

<em>The following message is brought to you by TechCrunch50 co-host <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a>.</em>

In order to build excitement for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/blog/">TechCrunch50 conference</a> we've convinced the bean counters at TechCrunch HQ to let us give away one $2,500 ticket a day for the next 45 days. That's more than $100,000 worth of TechCrunch50 tickets.

So, if you're broke, laid off or too cheap to buy a ticket, all you have to do is hit your followers with the hashtag #techcrunch50 at the end of each tweet. Every Tweet you send out is another chance to win the ticket being given away that day.

Every day we will pick one of the tweets from the previous day with the #techcrunch50 hashtag at random.

Some rules:]]></description>

<p>Every day we will pick one of the tweets from the previous day with the #techcrunch50 hashtag at random.</p>
<p>Some rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tweets should be relevant to startups, entrepreneurism or the the conference itself.</li>
<li> If you do something insane like create 20 accounts and spam twitter with 1,000 tweets a second we&#8217;ll bounce you from the drawing (and they will turn off your account!).</li>
<li>You can only win one ticket.</li>
<li>We will announce the previous day&#8217;s winner each day at noon pacific or thereabouts on the <a href="http://twitter.com/techcrunch50">@techcrunch50</a> twitter account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck and we appreciate your support in this attempt to leverage social media to promote the conference. <img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />

			<title>Blubet Bets That You Want To Predict Things On Twitter</title>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-166.png" width="174" height="64" />There are 1.2 million predictions made on Twitter everyday. Those are numbers that the prediction startup <a href="http://blubet.com">Blubet</a> pulled 2 weeks ago from the service. That's roughly 5% to 6% of the overall tweets being sent out on any given day, according to their data. So it's really not surprising that Blubet would want to build its business around this platform.

That wasn't always the case. When the company started on the idea of Blubet a couple years ago, as an offshoot of the community gaming site <a href="http://www.dotblu.com/default.aspx">dotblu</a>, the idea was that it would be more of a traditional site. But then Twitter exploded in popularity, and Blubet knew that it simply couldn't ignore the expanding social graph and platform that Twitter offers. So now Blubet is entirely built on top of Twitter. It has its own separate site, but for the site to work as it's intended, you have to tweet out predictions you make on the site, and get others to participate.

Of course, you can also do this from Twitter, using hashtags or DMs. But the preferred method is to visit the site and fill out a prediction. From there you can assign a value to the prediction which you will win (or lose) depending on how your bet does. And you can also see friend's predictions and give them a "yes" or "no" comment based on if you think they will come true or not.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87303" title="picture-166" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-166.png" alt="picture-166" width="174" height="64" />There are 1.2 million predictions made on Twitter everyday. Those are numbers that the prediction startup <a href="http://blubet.com">Blubet</a> pulled 2 weeks ago from the service. That&#8217;s roughly 5% to 6% of the overall tweets being sent out on any given day, according to their data. So it&#8217;s really not surprising that Blubet would want to build its business around this platform.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t always the case. When the company started on the idea of Blubet a couple years ago, as an offshoot of the community gaming site <a href="http://www.dotblu.com/default.aspx">dotblu</a>, the idea was that it would be more of a traditional site. But then Twitter exploded in popularity, and Blubet knew that it simply couldn&#8217;t ignore the expanding social graph and platform that Twitter offers. So now Blubet is entirely built on top of Twitter. It has its own separate site, but for the site to work as it&#8217;s intended, you have to tweet out predictions you make on the site, and get others to participate.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also do this from Twitter, using hashtags or DMs. But the preferred method is to visit the site and fill out a prediction. From there you can assign a value to the prediction which you will win (or lose) depending on how your bet does. And you can also see friend&#8217;s predictions and give them a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; comment based on if you think they will come true or not.</p>
<p>The idea here should be fairly obvious: This is all about social gaming. But unlike past social gaming Twitter <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/spymaster-the-twitter-game-that-will-assassinate-your-time/">services like Spymaster</a>, Blubet is being very cautious about what data it sends back to Twitter. For example, it prompts you before you sent a tweet back (which will include a link back to Blubet). If you opt to allow the tweet to go out, that setting will be remembered in the future (but you can always change it). But a key difference with the previous viral games of Twitter is that Blubet does not send DMs to your friends without your knowledge. And it does not currently allow for follow-up comments on prediction posts to get sent back to Twitter (though the site is thinking about that).</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87298" title="752359031_e6e2cb5d3e" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/752359031_e6e2cb5d3e.jpg" alt="752359031_e6e2cb5d3e" width="225" height="350" />If you make a prediction on Blubet, and it comes true, you get the number of points you wagered. If you get enough of these points, you level up. And there is a leader board to determine who is doing the best with their predictions. Right now, it&#8217;s run on a honor system, with other users charged with reporting a user if they&#8217;re lying about a prediction made.</p>
<p>And while these points don&#8217;t exactly translate into real-world currency (something which is a very gray area), there is a chance to use small transactions to get more points in the game. For example, if you pay $5, you get 1,000 ponits. $5 gets you 5,500 points. And $10 gets you 11,000 points. Obviously, this is step one for how the company plans to make money. But there are other plans too, including sponsor-created bets and intelligent automated bet creations.</p>
<p>Blubet founder and CEO Song Kim expects that sports and entertainment will eventually be the two dominant Twitter betting categories. That rings true. Tweeting about a game is one thing, but tweeting about how you think is going to win a game with points on the line, is another game entirely.</p>
<p>Blubet has raised $3.6 million in funding to date. The last round (its series A) came a few months ago led by D.E. Shaw. There is also an impressive roster of people who have invested in the past including Bebo founder Michael Birch and VCs Ron Conway and Jeff Clavier. Kim notes that the company has a low burn rate, and this money should last them a while.</p>
<p>While there are other startups in the prediction space on the web, notably <a href="http://www.hubdub.com/">Hubdub</a>, Blubet believes it&#8217;s the first to tackle the issue solely on Twitter. And given the 1.2 million prediction number, it seems like a good place to start.</p>
<p>There are also plans to integrate SMS service soon, and plans for both mobile web and apps for platforms likes the iPhone, in the future. Blubet currently consists of 7 employees.</p>

<strong>Part 6: Philips Enters the Picture 
</strong>
In the summer of 2006, I got a call from the president of Power Sentry to tell me that they were being bought by Philips, the Netherlands-based consumer electronics giant. My initial instinct was that this would be a mixed bag. They were just too large. He reassured that it would be great for the PowerSquid, with the awesome brand and marketing power of this giant, worldwide corporation suddenly behind our product. What really ended up happening was that the huge corporation barley noticed that it sold PowerSquid, since it had thousands and thousands of other products. The lack of focus quickly became evident as the relationship began to unfold. Most notably in their responsiveness to our needs as Flexity, which usually amounted to, “bad news delivered late.”  Nevertheless, we continued to push Flexity. Philips agreed to let us distribute their other power products to our customers, so we became a distributor of the original non-surge PowerSquid, as well as their lower-end (UL Listed) surge protectors.

We successfully sold the Calamari into Dell’s and Apple’s online stores, which were two of our major targets all along. Unfortunately, they both sequestered them to the last page of their surge protector sections. We had no “pay-to-play” money to get higher placement. With no special attention drawn to them and backwoods positioning, neither venue proved as successful as our own site. ]]></description>

<p>The acquisition, which was announced earlier this morning, calls for Sprint to pay $5.50 in stock for each Virgin Mobile share, a 31 percent premium to the MVNO&#8217;s closing share price Monday of $4.21. The deal is expected to receive approval either in the fall or in early 2010.</p>
<p>Sprint Nextel actually already owned 13.1 percent of Virgin Mobile, which uses the carrier&#8217;s network to offer service to some 5.2 million subscribers. The deal cancels out Virgin&#8217;s $248 million in outstanding debts and will unite Sprint&#8217;s Boost service and Virgin Mobile under the same roof. Sprint says it would keep the Virgin Mobile brand and let Virgin Mobile USA&#8217;s CEO Dan Schulman, run Sprint&#8217;s entire prepaid business if and when the deal closes late this year or early next.</p>
<p>In that case, Virgin Mobile shareholders will own about 3 percent of Sprint. Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Group owns 28.3 percent of Virgin Mobile, while South Korean carrier SK Telecom has a 15.3 percent stake that it got when Virgin Mobile last year <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/27/helio-hangs-it-up/">bought</a> <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/helio">Helio</a>, another prepaid carrier that uses Sprint&#8217;s network.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:VM">Virgin Mobile shares</a> jumped to $5.20 in premarket trading on Tuesday, while <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:S">Sprint shares</a> rose to $4.60 from their close at $4.55.</p>

Mike Hudack, the founder of <a href="http://blip.tv/">Blip.tv</a>, just landed a major set of deals to expand the distribution of his Web video network.  The biggest deal is with YouTube, which for the first time will allow Blip.tv to place its own ads in the YouTube player on behalf of the Web video creators who use Blip.   Hudack is also announcing distribution deals with NBC Local Media for regular TV starting in New York City, Vimeo, and Roku set-top boxes.  It is also expanding existing deals to show Blip videos on Verizon FIOS, Tivos, and Sony TVs with Ethernet jacks.

About 50,000 different shows have been uploaded to Blip, where video creators can then spread them across the Web, iTunes and set-top boxes.  According to the company, Blip is doing 72 million video streams a month to a worldwide audience of 22 million people.  Only 4 percent of those views are on Blip.tv itself.]]></description>

<p>Mike Hudack, the founder of <a href="http://blip.tv/">Blip.tv</a>, just landed a major set of deals to expand the distribution of his Web video network.  The biggest deal is with YouTube, which for the first time will allow Blip.tv to place its own ads in the YouTube player on behalf of the Web video creators who use Blip.   Hudack is also announcing distribution deals with NBC Local Media for regular TV starting in New York City, Vimeo, and Roku set-top boxes.  It is also expanding existing deals to show Blip videos on Verizon FIOS, Tivos, and Sony TVs with Ethernet jacks.</p>
<p>About 50,000 different shows have been uploaded to Blip, where video creators can then spread them across the Web, iTunes and set-top boxes.  According to the company, Blip is doing 72 million video streams a month to a worldwide audience of 22 million people.  Only 4 percent of those views are on Blip.tv itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we will double our audience with these deals,&#8221; says Hudack.  He might be able to double his audience with just YouTube, which comScore estimates does 6.6 billion streams a month and reaches about 100 million people in the U.S. alone. It is not so much distributing videos on YouTube that is a big deal. It is being able to share in the advertising revenues and getting tracking data back.  YouTube has gradually been making it easier for content partners to sell and place their own ads within YouTube, expanding from a few <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/21/exclusive-youtube-will-soon-let-big-content-partners-bring-their-own-ads/">large media partners</a> at the beginning of the year to about 50 today.</p>
<p>Now, YouTube is embracing smaller partners like Blip through a trial with a video ad network founded by ex-Googlers called <a href=" http://www.freewheel.tv/">FreeWheel</a>, which allows Blip and others to serve their own ads inside YouTube.  Blip still has to approve individual members before they can tap into those YouTube dollars, but once they pass muster they can use FreeWheel to set up their ads once to play on YouTube, Vimeo, Blip, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/28/bliptv-figures-out-how-to-serve-ads-in-itunes-videos/">iTunes</a>, or wherever.  FreeWheel takes care of the accounting and rev-shares, which gets complicated when teh money gets split so many ways.  Blip deos a 50/50 rev share with video creators after payments to third parties like YouTube and FreeWheel.</p>
<p>Along with the new distribution partnerships, Blip has completely redesigned its video management dashboard from the ground up.  (See screen shots below).  Web video auteurs can now see in one place how many views <em>and</em> dollars each episode of their videos is attracting. (<a href="http://www.tubemogul.com/">TubeMogul</a> is powering the analytics).   The dashboard lets them batch edit and distribute their videos.  They can drag and drop teh videos in teh episode list to reorder them, and the new order is automatically propagated to their RSS feed and all point so distribution. The embeddable Blip video player itself is also now much more customizable.  .</p>
<p>All of these changes should help Hudack get Blip closer to his &#8220;stretch&#8221; goal of becoming profitable this year.  He raised <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/21/bliptv-gets-some-safety-money-from-bain/">$5.2 million</a> from Bain Capital Ventures last October, which helped it get through the worst of the advertising downturn.  &#8220;What we found was that the first quarter sucked,&#8221; he says, &#8221; but April started leading a resurgence of advertising dollars.  Every month is a new record for us.&#8221;  The average cost advertising rates Blip gets are between $10 and $20 per thousand views.  </p>
<p>That YouTube deal should have the effect of increasing views while putting downward pressure on CPMs. But if views go up faster than prices go down, Blip will end up better off. </p>

The acquisition is subject to SPSS shareholder approval, regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, and is expected to close later in the second half of 2009.

Big Blue said the acquisition of the publicly-held Chicago company was expected to strengthen its information-agenda initiative, which helps companies take information and turn it into a strategic asset. <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=ibm">IBM shares</a> fell 67 cent to $116.96 in pre-market trading, while <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=spss">SPSS shares</a> jumped 41 percent to $49.59.

<p>A <a href="http://spss.com/JackMessage.htm">message</a> from SPSS Chairman, CEO &#038; President Jack Noonan:</p>
<blockquote><p>We and IBM view this as a highly-complementary move from both a technology and a market position perspective.</p>
<p>We’re excited about this agreement and the positive prospects that SPSS and IBM can achieve together in continuing to lead an industry that we helped shape.  The depth and breadth of IBM&#8217;s resources, its customer and market reach can only enhance our ability to address the growing market for Predictive Analytics. </p>
<p>In joining with IBM, we will advance Predictive Analytics as a competitive advantage for companies and organizations worldwide.  We see this as a transformative event that will accelerate the adoption of Predictive Analytics. </p>
<p>Between now and the acquisition close, we will continue to support our customers and partners in normal fashion. Existing contracts will remain in effect, account relationships and support infrastructure will remain unchanged.</p></blockquote>
<p>Predictive analytics software captures and analyzes data about people’s attributes, attitudes and behaviors to gain a full understanding of anticipated future behaviors, so companies can make smarter decisions for improved business outcomes.</p>
<p>IBM says it will continue to support and enhance SPSS technologies while allowing customers to take advantage of its own product portfolio. SPSS will become part of the Information Management division within the Software Group business unit, led by Ambuj Goyal, General Manager, IBM Information Management.</p>

I was reading Darnell's blog and I noticed something funny: back in May, he <a href="http://www.eclectic-mayhem.com/blog/2008/05/friendfork.html">blogged</a> about his experiences playing around with <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> and coming up with <a href="http://friendfork.appspot.com/">FriendFork</a>.

Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation in a statement says people can contribute to Linux in a variety of ways (writing code, marketing, etc.) but now have a convenient way of identifying themselves as supporters of the community "by carrying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">Tux</a> in their pocket".

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tux-card.png" />The <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a>, the non-profit that supports the growth of the Linux kernel, is today announcing an <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/linux-credit-card">affinity Visa Platinum credit card</a> for people who want to contribute to advancing the OS through the organization&#8217;s initiatives. Reading the press release announcing the new credit card made me raise my eyebrows, but after giving it a bit of thought I think that this is actually not that bad an idea.</p>
<p>Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation in a statement says people can contribute to Linux in a variety of ways (writing code, marketing, etc.) but now have a convenient way of identifying themselves as supporters of the community &#8220;by carrying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">Tux</a> in their pocket&#8221;. And then of course there&#8217;s the financial incentive.</p>
<p>The Linux Foundation is partnering with <a href="http://www.cardpartner.com/">CardPartner</a> to offer the credit card through <a href="https://www.umb.com/Personal/index.html">UMB Bank</a>. The organization will receive $50 for every activated card as well as a percentage of every purchase made with the credit card. The Linux Foundation also says 100% of the proceeds from the Visa card program will go directly towards providing community technical events and travel grants for open source community members in order to accelerate Linux innovation.</p>
<p>Initially, the custom Linux Foundation Visa Platinum card is only available to U.S. residents, but the organization expects to expand in the coming months. You can apply <a href="http://www.cardpartner.com/app/the-linux-foundation">here</a>.</p>
<p>Linus must be glowing with pride.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> there&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.linuxfund.org/">LinuxFund.org</a>, which looks similar and has been around since 1999.

Now we&#8217;ve learned from a reliable source that MySpace is besting that by a significant margin, with around 700,000 invitations sent per day.</p>
<p>MySpace has been working to improve its events platform for some time, releasing a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/myspaces-experimental-new-events-product-finally-taps-into-the-social-graph/">new application</a> last March that was built by Slingshot Labs, MySpace&#8217;s secretive startup incubator.  The new application&#8217;s biggest improvement was its integration of MySpace&#8217;s social graph — something that the older MySpace events application had largely failed to tap into.  Since then the app has seen a number of improvements, including the ability for users to widely distribute (or &#8216;blast&#8217;) invitations to a single event to many of their friends, which has proven useful for the site&#8217;s many bands, and likely helped spur growth in the number of invitations sent overall.</p>
<p>Of course, the elephant in the room here is Facebook, which has a massively popular Events feature.  But the social network doesn&#8217;t publish its stats, and when asked for comment it would only respond that the site sees &#8220;2.5 million events created each month&#8221;.  This says nothing about the number of invitations sent, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it has far more than either MySpace or Evite (to give an idea, Evite says that it only gets <a href="http://www.evite.com/pages/gt/advertise/ad_facts.jsp">570 thousand</a> events created per month — less than a quarter of what Facebook sees).</p>

And in the tech world, we have some good smack talking from Verizon directed at rival AT&amp;T today.</p>
<p>John Czwartacki, who is the policy blog editor for Verizon, sent the following <a href="http://twitter.com/CZ/status/2881325142">public message</a> on Twitter, &#8220;<em>This what USA&#8217;s most reliable wireless network sends BEFORE a conference. #VDC</em>&#8220;— complete with <a href="http://twitpic.com/bvs3o">a TwitPic</a> (below) of a giant Verizon truck parked outside the conference to bolster signal.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t mention AT&amp;T specifically, but he doesn&#8217;t have to. His next tweet repeats the message, but <a href="http://twitter.com/CZ/status/2881350461">directed</a> at me. Clearly he&#8217;s been reading  our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rants against</a> AT&amp;T&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">poor service</a>, most recently about AT&amp;T <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/video-att-iphone-hell/">having problems</a> during Comic-Con in San Diego.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, AT&amp;T reached out to me the other day saying it felt that it did a good job handling the onslaught of Comic-Con traffic on day 2. Of course, that still doesn&#8217;t speak to why it was bad on day one, when the company undoubtedly knew they were going to see a surge of usage. And that&#8217;s what Verizon&#8217;s tweet speaks to, nipping problems in the butt before they become problems. Judging from SXSW and Comic-Con, apparently that&#8217;s too much to ask from AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has been a trending topic on Twitter multiple times over the past few weeks — and never for a good reason. Verizon is just the latest to jump on the bandwagon of trashing the service on Twitter. Will AT&amp;T respond? Can it?</p>

Now comes even worse news: we've learned that Apple has blocked Google's official Google Voice application itself from the App Store.  In other words, Google Voice — one of the best things to happen to telephony services in a <i>very</i> long time — will have no presence at all on the App Store.  If there's ever been a time to be furious with Apple, now is it.

A Google Spokesperson has told us the following:


<blockquote>We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone.  Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store.  We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users -- for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.</blockquote>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-551.png" class="shot2"/>Earlier today we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">learned</a> that Apple had begun to pull all Google Voice-enabled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">applications</a> from the App Store, citing the fact that they &#8220;duplicate features that come with the iPhone&#8221;.  Now comes even worse news: we&#8217;ve learned that Apple has blocked Google&#8217;s official Google Voice application itself from the App Store.  In other words, Google Voice — one of the best things to happen to telephony services in a <i>very</i> long time — will have no presence at all on the App Store.  If there&#8217;s ever been a time to be furious with Apple, now is it.</p>
<p>A Google Spokesperson has told us the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone.  Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store.  We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users &#8212; for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not hard to guess who&#8217;s behind the restriction: our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">old friend</a> AT&#038;T.  Google Voice scares the carriers.  It allows users to send free SMS messages and get cheap long-distance over Google Voice&#8217;s lines.  It also makes it trivial to switch to a new phone service, because everyone calls the Google Voice number anyway.  Carriers have known about Google Voice for a long time, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that it began accepting new users, and there has still been some hassle associated with actually using the service.  Smartphone apps like GV Mobile remove many of those hassles, which is why AT&#038;T is keen to keep them off the iPhone (Google already has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">official</a> apps available for BlackBerry and Android).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another testament to just how ridiculous this move is: GV Mobile&#8217;s developer Sean Kovacs <a href="http://twitter.com/seankovacs/status/2876599172">says that</a> the app was personally approved last April by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Phil Schiller</a>, Apple&#8217;s senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing — the man who often takes the stage during Apple keynotes when Steve Jobs isn&#8217;t around.  Kovacs says that Schiller called him to personally apologize for the delay in initially getting the application approved.  Now, I&#8217;m sure Apple has laid out in its terms of service somewhere that you&#8217;re not allowed to mimic the iPhone&#8217;s functionality.  But when you&#8217;ve got a blessing from that high up, that would seem like a pretty good indication that the application belongs in the App Store.</p>
<p>The thing that really bothers me about the move is that Apple is now actively stifling innovation.  Google Voice is the kind of service that can actually have a positive impact on your life, and not in a frivolous, entertainment-related sense.  It makes it easier to connect with people, and to manage those connections.  Apple can point to the App Store&#8217;s 50,000 applications all it wants, but how many of them could truly be called groundbreaking?  Are they really putting a dent in the universe? </p>
<p>All the more upsetting is that this comes from the company that Steve Jobs built. The company that once made record labels bow to a flat 0.99 pricing structure for years longer than they would have liked is now screwing customers because AT&#038;T asked them to.  They&#8217;re trying to limit what I can and can&#8217;t run on my mobile phone — a phone whose marketing is largely based on its extensibility.</p>
<p>Back when the App Store first launched there were some warnings about its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/apples-app-store-the-new-walled-garden/">walled garden</a> approach — could developers trust Apple to maintain a fair marketplace?  Until recently, Apple has managed the store in a generally benevolent,  if not somewhat <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/22/feel-like-shaking-a-baby-to-death-theres-an-app-for-that/">incompetent</a> manner.  But now things are taking a turn for the worse.  From a handicapped <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10239277-37.html">Sling</a> app to blocked apps from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/qik-brings-live-video-to-the-iphone-3gs-but-you-still-wont-find-it-in-the-app-store/">Qik</a> and Google Voice, it&#8217;s becoming clear that Apple is doing its best to keep many of the iPhone&#8217;s most game-changing apps <i>away</i> from users.  Palm, if you&#8217;re looking for marketing material — take note.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: John Gruber has <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/google_voice#update-13:40">confirmed</a> with a trusted source that AT&#038;T is to blame for the Google Voice ban.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tony-hsieh-215x147.jpg" width="215" height="147" />If Zappos was a<a href="http://www.pehub.com/45388/zappos-ceo-wanted-to-stay-independent-sequoia-wanted-liquidity%E2%80%94sources/"> forced sale</a>, would someone please come force me a raise?

Zappos just  filed its <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&#38;p=irol-SECText&#38;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2NjYm4uMTBrd2l6YXJkLmNvbS94bWwvZmlsaW5nLnhtbD9yZXBvPXRlbmsmaXBhZ2U9NjQzMjk5MCZhdHRhY2g9T04mc1hCUkw9MQ%3d%3d">S4</a> with the Securities &#38; Exchange Commission, which details the history of the merger talks with Amazon. There's a lot of boring boilerplate here, but one of the more interesting bits is on page 68, where there's a confusing breakdown of Zappos' ownership.

The percentages appear to add up to way over 100% because the shares of Venture Frogs are essentially counted three times. Venture Frogs was the firm Zappos CEO and CFO Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin used to own that first invested in Zappos back in 1999. Because either of them "could" contol the voting shares, the SEC counts each of the shares under their names, as well as under the Venture Frogs name.

But once you back that out, one thing is clear: No one could sell the company without the blessing of Hsieh and Lin. CEO Hsieh owns 29.4% of the common shares, CFO Lin owns another 2.7% and Venture Frogs-- the firm they started and jointly manage-- owns another 39.9% of the shares.]]></description>

<p>Zappos just  filed its <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2NjYm4uMTBrd2l6YXJkLmNvbS94bWwvZmlsaW5nLnhtbD9yZXBvPXRlbmsmaXBhZ2U9NjQzMjk5MCZhdHRhY2g9T04mc1hCUkw9MQ%3d%3d">S4</a> with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, which details the history of the merger talks with Amazon. There&#8217;s a lot of boring boilerplate here, but one of the more interesting bits is on page 68, where there&#8217;s a confusing breakdown of Zappos&#8217; ownership.</p>
<p>The percentages appear to add up to way over 100% because the shares of Venture Frogs are essentially counted three times. Venture Frogs was the firm Zappos CEO and CFO Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin used to own that first invested in Zappos back in 1999. Because either of them &#8220;could&#8221; contol the voting shares, the SEC counts each of the shares under their names, as well as under the Venture Frogs name.</p>
<p>But once you back that out, one thing is clear: No one could sell the company without the blessing of Hsieh and Lin. CEO Hsieh owns 29.4% of the common shares, CFO Lin owns another 2.7% and Venture Frogs&#8211; the firm they started and jointly manage&#8211; owns another 39.9% of the shares.</p>
<p>Sequoia owned 22% of the company, but made different returns depending on the liquidation preferences in each term sheet. In all, the firm is poised to make a return of roughly $160 million, based on Amazon&#8217;s closing price today. Sequoia invested $35 million over the companies E and F rounds. Not bad.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much harder to see how much Hsieh and Lin are making, because no one knows how much of the proceeds of the Venture Frogs shares goes to their pockets or to their LPs. But they clearly did well. Hsieh made at least $214 million; Lin made at least $18 million, with the Venture Frogs shares netting an additional $163 million. If that&#8217;s a forced sale, the two are crying all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>Another shocker from the S4: Zappos&#8217; revenues. We&#8217;re so used to that $1 billion-in-gross-merchandise-sales figure being bandied about that people tend to confuse that with Zappos&#8217; <em>actual sales</em>. But that number doesn&#8217;t count returns, which can be as high as 40% according to people close to the company. The real sales from 2008 were $635 million, up from $527 million in 2007. In the first quarter of 2009, Zappos grew revenues at a clip of 8%.</p>
<p>So while you can argue Amazon still got a great deal; Hsieh and Lin did pretty well too. That makes it all the more impressive that they&#8217;re sticking around to keep growing the company rather than heading to a remote beach.</p>

Google finally sold back its 5 percent stake in AOL to Time Warner.  Originally valued at $1 billion in 2005, Google ended up <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">getting back only $283 million</a>, including some cash distributions.

Time Warner took back the shares in preparation for the eventual <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/time-warner-to-decide-on-aol-spinoff-at-thursday-board-meeting-its-a-done-deal/">public spinoff of AOL</a>.

<p>Google finally sold back its 5 percent stake in AOL to Time Warner.  Originally valued at $1 billion in 2005, Google ended up <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">getting back only $283 million</a>, including some cash distributions.  There goes roughly $700 million, but Google already <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">took a writedown</a> on the investment back in the fourth quarter when the whole world was going to pot and nobody really noticed.</p>
<p>Time Warner took back the shares in preparation for the eventual <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/time-warner-to-decide-on-aol-spinoff-at-thursday-board-meeting-its-a-done-deal/">public spinoff of AOL</a>.  When Google initially bought the shares, it valued AOL at $20 billion.  Based on the price Time Warner paid for the repurchase of the shares, AOL is now worth $5.7 billion.  I&#8217;m sure by the time it actually goes public, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/google-ad-chief-tim-armstrong-replaces-randy-falco-as-chairman-and-ceo-of-aol/">new CEO Tim Armstrong</a> and AOL&#8217;s bankers are going to be arguing that it is worth a lot more.</p>
<p>So did Google get hosed on this investment?  Pretty much.  But you have to remember that it was part of a larger search outsourcing deal which Google still makes money from today.  AOL on its own commands a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/bing-gains-some-search-share-from-yahoo/">3 percent</a> search market share and as such is probably Google&#8217;s largest partner site.  Even if Google didn&#8217;t make back its investment over the past four years, the search volume AOL provides itself is worth paying for.  (Search is a volume game, the more search queries you can throw ads against, the better the ROI).  So don&#8217;t feel too bad for Google.  It was buying distribution which helped it maintain its overall market dominance.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  According to this <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468516/000095015709000443/ex99-1.htm">preliminary IPO document</a> AOL filed with the SEC, last year the Google search partnership generated $678 million in search advertising revenues for AOL, or 32 percent of its total advertising revenues.  Assuming that AOL struck an advantageous revenue sharing deal with Google and gets to keep at least 80 percent, that would mean Google&#8217;s 20 percent brought it $170 million in revenues.  Multiply that by five years (the deal expires in 2010), add in the $283 million it got back for the shares, and it comes out of the whole deal with $1.1 billion.  This is all back-of-the-envelope, but it is not hard to see how Google basically broke even on its investment.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87086" title="img_5" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/img_5.jpg" alt="img_5" width="320" height="280" />Last week, we wrote about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/bing-twitter-and-a-backpack-full-of-cash-hopefully-for-beer/">Bing Cashback contest</a> that rewards Bing searchers with a chance to win a $500 gift card. Well, the contest is in full swing, and if today is any indication, to win, you don&#8217;t even need to have the correct answer.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s question was: &#8220;<em>Bing #cashbackpack Trivia: What Bing cashback percentage does drugstore.com offer?</em>&#8221; To find the answer, simply search for something like &#8220;“drugstore.com bing cash back” on Bing, and you&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=“drugstore.com+bing+cash+back”&amp;go=&amp;form=QBLH&amp;qs=n">see the sponsored result</a> right at the top.</p>
<p>The answer? 20%. The problem? The winner <a href="http://twitter.com/hussain_sattu/status/2874025319">said</a> 10%.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t stop the Bing Cashback account from <a href="http://twitter.com/bingcashback/status/2877349420">tweeting out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bing #cashbackpack Trivia: Congrats @hussain_sattu -today&#8217;s lucky winner for the $500 cash card in the Bing backpack!</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what else is odd. The winner follows one user on Twitter, Bing Cashback. And they have a total of 4 tweets, 3 of which are for the Cashback content (and the other is &#8220;studying&#8221; — this contest is supposed to be for students). This is leading some to question if the entire thing isn&#8217;t rigged, or at the very least being gamed. Regardless, one thing seems very clear: Whoever is running the contest for Microsoft isn&#8217;t paying too much attention.</p>
<p>The contest is kind of a joke anyway. Once someone goes out and finds the answer, it looks like a bunch of other Twitter users are just repeating it, to try and win.</p>
<p>What an awesome contest. I think I&#8217;ll play tomorrow. When they ask for the correct cashback percentage for some website, my answer will be &#8220;watermelon.&#8221; I&#8217;m so gonna win that $500.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Now Bing is <a href="http://twitter.com/bingcashback/status/2877981444">saying</a> that on a sub-site, 10% was listed for whatever reason, so it accepted that answer along with the 20% answer. May want to get those promotions in line Bing.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sept2-215x92.jpg" width="215" height="92" />

Twitter is getting a <a href="http://wthashtag.com/Sept2nd">ton</a> of spam tonight for the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23sept2nd">#sept2nd</a> along with vague sounding warnings about something bad happening on that date. There's also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT6N_PZuY-Q">YouTube video</a> and a <a href="http://digg.com/world_news/9_02_09">Digg story</a> that is just starting to get clicks.

What is it? Some 4Chan users are <a href="http://img.4chan.org/b/res/150104125.html">trying</a> to stir up some good old fashioned fear. A message urges readers to <em>"Write "9/02/09" on flyers, stickers, currency, walls, etc. and put them EVERYWHERE....Tweet with the hashtag #sept2nd. Get it into the trending topics....Help get the youtube video into the popular section (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT6N_PZuY-Q)...Spam Google with "9.02.09""</em>

This is much more likely to create a big annoyance for everyone rather than the intended effect of <em>"its gonna be hilarious seeing everyone freak out."</em> Traditionally 4Chan has been much better at just <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/time-magazine-throws-up-its-hands-as-it-gets-pwned-by-4chan/">raining on parades</a> than than creating any serious mayhem.

But there's an upside, too. All those people twittering out that hashtag make up an excellent and tidy block list. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11-215x190.jpg" width="215" height="190" />News broke last week that the latest developer builds of Chrome include <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10299814-92.html">support for themes</a>. And a few sites even found a couple of them that you can easily install right now using special links. But links are a less than ideal way of installing these themes since you can't see what they look like before you turn them on. Luckily, Google appears ready to launch a theme directory for the skins.

The site, which will reside <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">here</a>, is not live yet. But on the default new tab/new window page, the one with the thumbnails of your most visited sites, if you click on the "X" to remove some of them, a themes page shows up as a thumbnail (see included screenshot).]]></description>

And a few sites even found a couple of them that you can easily install right now using special links. But links are a less than ideal way of installing these themes since you can&#8217;t see what they look like before you turn them on. Luckily, Google appears ready to launch a theme directory for the skins.</p>
<p>The site, which will reside <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">here</a>, is not live yet. But on the default new tab/new window page, the one with the thumbnails of your most visited sites, if you click on the &#8220;X&#8221; to remove some of them, a themes page shows up as a thumbnail (see included screenshot).</p>
<p>When you click on the thumbnail, it takes you to the not-live-yet page. But the thumbnail clearly shows this page will have a bunch of themes for Chrome. My superior counting skills tell me there are 24 themes shown in that thumbnail alone.</p>
<p>This little trick to get the themes directory thumbnail to show up works in the latest developer builds of Chrome for both Windows and Mac (I haven&#8217;t tried it on Linux).</p>
<p>Speaking of Chrome for Mac, it continues to come along nicely, with limited <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/dont-look-now-but-flash-is-kind-of-working-on-chrome-for-mac/">support for Flash</a> just being added recently. We&#8217;re told it&#8217;s working in the Linux build as well. Alongside themes, improved support for extensions is included in this new Chrome build.</p>
<p>Themes have been available on Chrome for a while, but they used to require you to download files and know which folder to drop them in. It was also hard to revert to the original one. This latest build allows for push-button skinning and an easy way to revert. You can find two of the Chrome themes on <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/">this page</a> (theme.crx is &#8220;Camo,&#8221; theme2.crx is &#8220;Snowflake&#8221;). Click on them and then click &#8220;download&#8221; on the next page from within the new build of Chrome to install them.</p>

First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Google announced Chrome OS</a>, the company's first operating system. Then Microsoft <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/why-chrome-os-now-because-microsoft-office-in-the-cloud-comes-monday/">announced</a> the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/the-complete-guide-to-microsofts-office-2010/">new version of Office</a> with major cloud app support. Then Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-the-most-important-facts-and-some-opinion/">its deal</a> to take over Yahoo's search business. Starting today, Google is back on the offensive, with a major promotional campaign to get the word out about organizations switching to Google apps for their daily computing needs.

The campaign, called "<a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/gogoogle.html">Going Google</a>," has a very clear target: Microsoft Office. A series of advertisements [<em>disclosure: including on this blog</em>] will begin touting how and why some 3,000 organizations are signing up to use Google apps each day. But the crown jewels of this campaign will be billboards on four major U.S. highways that will give a new message about Google apps everyday for a month.

The billboards will be placed on the 101 in San Francisco, the West Side Hwy in New York, the Ike in Chicago, and Mass Pike in Boston. Google says that the vinyl being used to create these new messages each day will be recycled or reused into either computer bags or shopping bags.]]></description>

Starting today, Google is back on the offensive, with a major promotional campaign to get the word out about organizations switching to Google apps for their daily computing needs.</p>
<p>The campaign, called &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/gogoogle.html">Going Google</a>,&#8221; has a very clear target: Microsoft Office. A series of advertisements [<em>disclosure: including on this blog</em>] will begin touting how and why some 3,000 organizations are signing up to use Google apps each day. But the crown jewels of this campaign will be billboards on four major U.S. highways that will give a new message about Google apps everyday for a month.</p>
<p>The billboards will be placed on the 101 in San Francisco, the West Side Hwy in New York, the Ike in Chicago, and Mass Pike in Boston. Google says that the vinyl being used to create these new messages each day will be recycled or reused into either computer bags or shopping bags.</p>
<p>Google says that so far over 1.75 million businesses, schools and organizations have signed up to use the various combinations of Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and the other Google apps. But that is of course a drop in the bucket compared to the number of companies that use Microsoft Office and its other enterprise solutions. Now, Google is clearly trying to be proactive in telling people why its solution is better before Office goes online in a big way with the 2010 version.</p>
<p>Google is also attempting to use the viral message platform of choice these days to spread the &#8220;Going Google&#8221; message: Twitter. At the bottom of its blog post on the matter, Google urges people that use its apps to &#8220;Tweet your story&#8221; and provides a link to auto-populate a tweet with the #gonegoogle hashtag. You can also follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/googleatwork">GoogleAtWork</a> Twitter account to follow the Gone Google stories.</p>
<p>It has also set up a site to &#8220;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/googleapps.com/go-google/">Spead the word</a>&#8221; about Going Google. This is similar to what Mozilla has long been doing to promote Firefox — and it&#8217;s worked to the tune of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/firefox-should-hit-1-billion-downloads-any-day-now/">over a billion downloads</a>. The site has a range of options for letting your company or organization know that you want it to &#8220;Go Google,&#8221; including things like fliers and pre-populated emails to send out.</p>
<p>And Google is also promising to give away &#8220;goodies&#8221; each week in August to users who have Gone Google and fill out a Google Doc describing their experience.</p>
<p>Will any of this work? Who knows. But I know that I can&#8217;t wait to see how Microsoft responds in this back-and-forth war. &#8220;Stay With Office&#8221; blimps, perhaps?</p>

So far, it has helped launch <a href="http://www.lolapps.com/">LOLapps</a> and <a href="http://www.thinglabs.com/">Thing Labs</a>, the startup behind <a href="http://www.brizzly.com/">Brizzly</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/10/brizzly-a-twitter-reader-from-the-people-who-brought-you-google-reader/">a new Twitter app</a> that was first shown at our Real-time Stream CrunchUp last month. And now they&#8217;re adding to the team.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ryan-spoon">Ryan Spoon</a>, formerly the Vice President of Marketing &amp; Business Development at <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/">Widgetbox</a>, is joining Polaris as a senior associate, with Dog Patch Labs being one of his key areas of focus. Like other senior associates, Spoon will also be helping to generally assess investment opportunities and work with portfolio companies, but he will be working out of the Dog Patch Labs at Pier 38 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Polaris general partner <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-hirshland">Mike Hirshland</a> describes the space, which they share with the startup <a href="http://socialmedia.com/">Social Media</a>, as sort of a &#8220;frat house for geeks.&#8221; It offers space for promising young entrepreneurs to work out of, giving them desks, bandwidth, lunch and coffee. And it offers all of this for free, with no commitment to Polaris required. The idea is that many of these startups aren&#8217;t quite at the investment-ready yet, but they can use the labs to work towards that.</p>
<p>Hirshland expects Spoon, who is also the founder of the sports social network <a href="http://www.ingamenow.com/">InGameNow</a> and the high school althete college recruiting service <a href="http://www.berecruited.com/">beRecruited</a>, to be a great resource for the entrepreneurs that hang out at the Dog Patch Labs. And he certainly has the right experience for the labs, Spoon is also the founder of <a href="http://www.sfentrepreneurs.com/">sfEntrepreneurs</a>, and SF-based collective for young entreprenuers. He also worked at eBay for nearly 5 years as the manager of the Internet marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://ryanspoon.com/blog/2009/08/02/joining-polaris-ventures-partners/">Spoon&#8217;s own post</a> on the move.</p>

			<title>Family In India Or The Philippines? Cheaply Boost Their Mobile Accounts With Aryty</title>

Unfortunately many people, particularly in poorer areas, find their credits dwindle toward zero with alarming frequency.  Enter <a href="http://www.aryty.com">Aryty</a>, a new startup that's looking to help mobile phone users in India and the Phillipines by giving them a highly efficient way to receive money from their loved ones abroad.


Aryty CEO Nils Johnson says that it is quite common for families in America who have loved ones in the Philippines or India to send money on a fairly regular basis as a reminder that they're thinking of them.  But standard wire transfers, especially for small amounts of money, tend to be highly inefficient because of the way fees are structured — you might pay in excess of $10 in fees for a wire transfer of only $20.

Unfortunately many people, particularly in poorer areas, find their credits dwindle toward zero with alarming frequency.  Enter <a href="http://www.aryty.com">Aryty</a>, a new startup that&#8217;s looking to help mobile phone users in India and the Phillipines by giving them a highly efficient way to receive money from their loved ones abroad.</p>
<p>Aryty CEO Nils Johnson says that it is quite common for families in America who have loved ones in the Philippines or India to send money on a fairly regular basis as a reminder that they&#8217;re thinking of them.  But standard wire transfers, especially for small amounts of money, tend to be highly inefficient because of the way fees are structured — you might pay in excess of $10 in fees for a wire transfer of only $20. </p>
<p>In contrast, Aryty has no fees.  Families can send money directly into the cellular accounts of their loved ones without losing anything in the process, which makes it more appealing for these &#8216;thinking of you&#8217; transfers.  To initiate a transfer, you simply enter your credit card information, and the credit is instantly added to the cellular account of your loved one abroad (they also receive a SMS message alerting them to the addition).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Aryty users will send relatively small amounts of credit on a regular basis — say, once a month or every two weeks.  The reason for the fairly small amounts is that most carriers in India and the Philippines don&#8217;t allow for &#8216;roll-over&#8217; credit, which means any excess amount left at the end of the month will expire.  Fortunately, Aryty also offers a scheduling feature that lets you send money as often as you&#8217;d like without having to remember.</p>
<p>Aryty has forged deals with major carriers in the Phillipines, and is now expanding into India, where it expects to have support for around 98% of the market by the end of the year.  And while Aryty doesn&#8217;t charge any fees, it can still make money — carriers sell the company minutes at a discount, which it can then resell at the standard rate.  Carriers like Aryty because it lowers user churn (users don&#8217;t want to switch carriers after they&#8217;ve established accounts that their family members are depositing money into).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 11 p.m. on a Sunday night when I notice that Twitter founder @ev has <a href="http://twitter.com/ev/status/2865919308">just tweeted</a> about <a href="http://www.twables.com/fb140">FB140</a>, our company <a href="http://www.twables.com">Twables&#8217;</a> days-old service that helps you find your Facebook friends on Twitter. Since our launch, I&#8217;ve felt like a surfer, waiting for a wave of users to start using our service. A few smaller waves have trickled through in our first days since launch, but Ev&#8217;s post represents something totally different.  I mean, here&#8217;s someone who has more than a million followers and receives personal messages from Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p>I was beyond excitement until I realized a tweet from @ev has the force of nuclear explosion.  And a nuclear explosion makes a very, very big wave. I quickly IM&#8217;d my only developer to warn him. Then I ran a Twitter search on Ev&#8217;s tweet and saw that it was getting retweeted. A lot. Between midnight and 6 a.m. alone, 170 people had retweeted him. &#8220;Frak,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;we might not scale.&#8221; For the next six hours, my developer began spinning up machines on Amazon, reworking our code and rolling it out overnight as we tried to ride the wave without having it crash down upon us. By then, we were doing more traffic in an hour than we had all week. Fortunately, he&#8217;s a killer Java programmer, and we&#8217;ve stayed afloat so far. By 6 a.m., exhausted, I reflected on three things I&#8217;ve learned since stumbling into development on the Twitter platform just two months ago.</p>
<p>1. Business hours are dead. 24/7 is the new 9 to 5. Real-time messaging means that anyone can start talking about your product at any time and that talk can snowball before you know it. I happened to see Ev&#8217;s post nine minutes after he sent it, but what if I hadn&#8217;t checked Twitter at all? Our site would have been down and a golden opportunity missed. As much as I love all the new technology (Amazon Web Services, Twitter APIs, Google Apps) that makes it possible for a two-person company to operate, it&#8217;s tough, if not impossible, for two people to be on call at all times. Perhaps this means that business guys like me are going to have to start wearing ops pagers (what? business people actually earning their paycheck?). How can you sleep for fear that someone will say something to tens of thousands of people that you really need to respond to. Is our only solution to never go to sleep?</p>
<p>2. The Borg has finally arrived. On Friday afternoon, I popped my head into Dave McClure&#8217;s office to shoot the breeze and mentioned a thought that Twitter was a bigger threat to MySpace than to Facebook. Before the words were out of my mouth, he had tweeted it, Dave-style. Instantly, people started to respond with their thoughts, and I realized that Dave was crowdsourcing our discussion before he&#8217;d even formed his own opinion. Will we all use the real-time world to have conversations? While Dave has the unfair advantage of a lot of followers, most of you are just at the beginning of your Twitter experience. I predict that you&#8217;ll join the Borg soon enough. The reality is that many of you are accustomed to asking those around you for advice. The difference is that now you&#8217;ll be able to accomplish your information-gathering process in minutes instead of weeks. Our company gets advice from users within hours of our initial launch and we are able to release changes for those users on the same day. If the dialogue with customers is now real-time, then the process of incorporating feedback needs to be real-time, too.  Sorry big companies, life is about to suck for you!</p>
<p>3. The Patriot Act can&#8217;t hold a candle to Citizen Paparazzi. An hour before Ev&#8217;s post, I was talking to two friends about Twitter. They mentioned that a friend of theirs had tweeted about their two-year-old son a few times, which they characterized as an &#8220;unusual&#8221; experience. Celebrities will finally have their revenge as two out of every three of your neighbors starts tweeting about everything you&#8217;re doing. The Supreme Court will have to revisit the definition of &#8220;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8221; when a father&#8217;s kid tweets that daddy is reading Playboy in the bathroom. (That happened to a buddy of mine. Not to me. A buddy of mine.) This may not seem like a new phenomenon, what with YouTube videos and the like already starting this trend. However, the pace at which things spread is now so close to real-time that it almost erases the line between past and present.  Real-time communication invites the world to experience your life with you, as it happens.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the world after Twitter will be better or worse. (For me, I think it will be better.) But when your tidal wave approaches, will you be ready to ride it?</p>

"I agree on the one condition it's not going to be a girl power post, ok"? That's what Gali Ross requested when I asked to profile her for TechCrunch.  So this isn't going to be a 'girl power' post, but the fact of the matter is that female entrepreneurs are a rare breed. Let's all try a mental game together… How many female startup CEO's can you name off the top of your head?  I am embarrassed to say that I have trouble coming up with more than a handful, but I don't think I am alone.   

Here's what I find strange about all this: I speak to VC's and private investors regularly, and have never EVER heard anyone comment negatively on deal-flow based on the entrepreneur's gender. Startups—at least this has been my experience—are weighted on the merits of the product, market and the team, but never on gender. Frankly, I can't explain why female entrepreneurs are a rare commodity in our industry. (Feel free to enlighten me about the gender bias underpinning the tech industry in comments).

The situation in Israel is not much different. But it should only be the quality that counts... To that end, here are three Israeli female entrepreneurs worth keeping tabs on:]]></description>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I find strange about all this: I speak to VC&#8217;s and private investors regularly, and have never EVER heard anyone comment negatively on deal-flow based on the entrepreneur&#8217;s gender. Startups—at least this has been my experience—are weighted on the merits of the product, market and the team, but never on gender. Frankly, I can&#8217;t explain why female entrepreneurs are a rare commodity in our industry. (Feel free to enlighten me about the gender bias underpinning the tech industry in comments).</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is not much different. But it should only be the quality that counts&#8230; To that end, here are three Israeli female entrepreneurs worth keeping tabs on:</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/amit_knaani.jpg" alt="Amit_Knaani" title="Amit_Knaani" width="333" height="500" class="alignright size-full wp-image-88873" /><strong>Amit Knaani</strong> is best known in the Israeli startup industry as the former Senior Product Manager of Wix.com. She quit the hot startup to join forces with Yami Glick, another well-known figure in the local startup scene. Together the two founded <a href="http://www.vikido.com">Vikido</a>, a video messaging service designed to allow kids (3-9) and their parents to send and receive video messages using an an interface with no reading prerequisites.</p>
<p>A mother of two girls (hence her familiarity with the need for such a product), Amit has been in our little industry for 10 years now, starting as a photo editor at Israel&#8217;s largest news site <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il">Ynet</a>. She then moved on to manage the biggest medical site in Israel <a href="http://doctors.co.il/">doctors.co.il</a>, doing everything from spec&#8217;ing to selling media to business development. It was there that she started thinking about the idea for Vikido, mostly due to gaps of communication experienced by sick kids (information, connection with friends and parents). </p>
<p>By then it was clear to her that she wanted to be involved in consumer products with strong community reach and the ability to make an impact on people and what they do on the web. That&#8217;s when the Wix gig came about. </p>
<p>Team Vikido is planning to launch its product in September. In the mean time they are hustling to get funding, writing code, and chronicling the trials and tribulations of startup life in a weekly article series on Ynet called &#8216;The Transparent Startup&#8217;.</p>

<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/orit1.jpg" alt="Orit_Hashay" title="Orit_Hashay" width="333" height="494" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88874" /><strong>Orit Hashay</strong> has also been active in in Israeli startups for over 10 years, having taken on software and business development posts with public companies such as Emblaze and Comverse, as well as consulting for various Israeli startups.</p>
<p>Orit is also somewhat of a local serial entrepreneur. She&#8217;s founded a Yelp-ish review site called <a href="http://www.ramkol.co.il">Ramkol.co.il</a> and <a href="http://www.mit4mit.co.il">mit4mit.co.il</a>, the second most popular wedding review site in Israel. Most recently Orit held the Entrepreneur in Residence role at <a href="http://www.decimaventures.com">Decima Ventures</a>, where she was responsible for technical and market analysis. Decima is also where her newest venture, <a href="http://www.vetrinas.com">Vetrinas</a> was born.</p>
<p>Vetrinas is a virtual shopping window to hundreds of stores from across the fashion Meccas of the world, be it London, New York, Paris or Milan. Vetrinas is targeting three segments: Consumers with an interest in high-fashion. Retailers that want to expose potential on/offline shoppers to specific products or brand advertising. And finally, shop window designers that can display their work (art) in order to attain job offers.</p>
<p>Orit coded all of Vetrina&#8217;s herself and intends to generate revenue by way of affiliation through the site and rev-share through widgets that will syndicate content to blogs and websites. Vetrinas is currently in Alpha. </p>

She took physics, math <em>and</em> political science. Not having gone unnoticed, she went on to become an intelligence officer in the Israeli Defense Forces and then later an Information Systems Engineering graduate of the Technion (Israel&#8217;s MIT).</p>
<p>She then joined eWave where she kept busy with project management and, afterward, marketing, sales and business development. Two years later she joined Israeli dev house Clementina as COO. That&#8217;s where she worked with Israeli startups such as my6sense, Spikko, and Footbo. Temptation was in the air and Gali couldn&#8217;t resist so she recruited a partner and founded <a href="http://www.razoss.com">Razoss</a>.</p>
<p>Gali is still very protective of her product so details and access are limited. In vague terms it can be described as a browser-based content promotion platform, where the idea is to enhance the browser beyond content display, to content management and distribution. </p>
<p>Initial funding was provided by Dr. Yossi Vardi a little over a year ago and a second investment is near closing. The product is in private alpha, with a wider release intended in a few months. </p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twolves.png" class="shot2"/>Every day, sports fans congregate at their nearest big-league stadium to bask in each other&#8217;s cheers, body paint, and beer, relishing their shared enthusiasm for the teams they love.  But then the game ends.  Everyone is forced to head back to their normal lives to trudge through their day jobs once more, at least til the next home game comes round.  Social media can offer them some comfort, giving them a chance to take the community home with them.  Unfortunately, many professional sports teams are still failing to tap into this effectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fanchatter.com">FanChatter</a>, a <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded company that&#8217;s launching today, is a startup that&#8217;s looking to help fix this problem.  The company is focused on helping major sports teams increase engagement both during and after games using user-submitted content, Twitter, and other social services.  And while the company is still quite new, it&#8217;s already got some major customers, including the Minnesota Twins, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the University of Oaklahoma. </p>
<p>One of the site&#8217;s core features is its photo gallery.  During games, fans are encouraged to Email photos taken from their cell phones to a designated Email address, for the chance to have their photos appear on the stadium&#8217;s Jumbotron.  Teams receive the photos in real-time and build photo galleries from them, which they can then use in place of the candid video shots we&#8217;ve all seen so many times between innings or during a time-out.  Obviously teams aren&#8217;t able to display <i>every</i> photo submitted, but FanChatter also takes these photos and builds a shared photo album — one for each game — which can then be accessed by fans from the team&#8217;s home page.  You can see what these albums look like by checking out the Twins&#8217; page <a href="http://twins.fanchatter.com/">here</a>.  Fans will also soon be able to share their videos taken at the game, though these likely won&#8217;t be appearing on the Jumbotron as they take too long to filter through.</p>
<p>Another of the company&#8217;s features is the ChatterBox, a widget that can display a stream of tweets relevant to a particular hashtag or topic (the Timberwolves have one that shows tweets with the tag #twolves).  Fans can use this to communicate during the game, and to follow the latest news from home.  The widget is similar to one that&#8217;s offered by <a href="http://www.tinker.com">Tinker</a>, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/30/tinker-gives-twitter-its-long-awaited-events-firehose/">launched</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>FanChatter licenses its technology with fees set on a case-by-case basis, and has plans to extend its technology beyond sports to include other major events, like concerts.  It also has plans to roll out iPhone applications, which would give fans a better way to interact with each other while they&#8217;re still at the game.<br />

By which I mean, I feel like my insides aren't fully developed, I have no strength in my arms or legs and the idea of eating solid food is just a distant dream.

It's all <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/silicon-valley-its-time-to-clean-up/">Lacy's fault</a>, of course, she actually pays for this nonsense every month or so and claims it's the reason why she no longer gets sick when she travels. Arrington and Heather apparently swear by it too.

The rest of TechCrunch, meanwhile, are beyond skeptical, bandying around words like "science" and "proof" in a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that they're in the pay of Big Cheeseburger. Whatever the truth, I've bet Lacy fifty dollars that the only thing the cleanse will achieve for me is crippling hunger and a loss of feeling in my extremities, so I'm in for the duration. At least as I lie on my deathbed, puking water and romaine-and-celery juice into a cardboard bowl, I can comfort myself with the fact that it was free - a promotion by the company to tempt California-based hacks into starving themselves to death. Journalistic freebies for the win (see my statement of ethics: <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/hack-to-the-future-my-long-overdue-statement-of-ethics/">here</a>).

Speaking of ethics, I'm just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as 'Geeks At The Beach', the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don't. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up 'influential' social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it's heading next. In Los Angeles.

<p>Speaking of ethics, I&#8217;m just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as &#8216;Geeks At The Beach&#8217;, the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don&#8217;t. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up &#8216;influential&#8217; social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it&#8217;s heading next. In Los Angeles. On a beach.</p>
<p>Lacy and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> would be there - so far, so good - but so too would Seaworld-friendly haircaster, <a href="http://julia.nonsociety.com">Julia Allison</a>; LA-based red-carpet dweller, <a href="http://www.ShiraLazar.com">Shira Lazar</a> and various life-casters and me-bloggers whose existence I was only dimly aware of. I hesitated for a moment in accepting: what was supposed to be a meeting of minds could very easily be a train wreck of egos and bikinis and Flipcams and bullshit. Or, to put it another way: the best. column. ever. Count me in.</p>
<p>As it turned out, my worries were only half founded. Yes, there were Flipcams, and lots of egos and bullshit - these were bloggers and life-casters, after all. Yes, at one point the conversation touched a little too closely on whether cupcakes were more or less important than politics in driving community discussions. And yes, certainly, some of those in attendance were clearly more interested in the beach part than the geeks part of the event. But as the day went on, a hardcore group of us - including but certainly not limited to me, Scoble, Lacy and J.R. - really did get down to some proper, substantive debate over two issues that occupy almost every day of our lives. The first was Internet anonymity - my thoughts on which you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/nsfw-bringing-nothing-to-techcrunch-and-a-brand-new-reality-to-the-unter-trolls">enjoyed last week</a> - and the second was the future of journalism, and how life-casting and unpaid blogging most certainly isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a horribly pompous misconception amongst bloggers that they are somehow &#8216;taking on the mainstream media&#8217;. &#8220;Those old losers just don&#8217;t get it!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;We bloggers are on the scene first, asking tough questions before the mainstream media have even put their shoes on&#8221;. Indeed, as uber-blogger Scoble pointed out, taking another sip from his glass of free sake, there were no AP photographers on the plane that went down in the Hudson.</p>
<p>When it comes to a certain type of highly visible breaking news, no-one can argue that social media kicks the mainstream media&#8217;s ass. At any given disaster, there&#8217;s possibly a 0.01% chance that a professional journalist or photographer will already be on the scene, compared to 100% odds that there&#8217;ll be some dude with a camera-phone there. And as for asking tough questions: yep, bloggers are pretty good at that too - hardly a syllable can slip from the mouth of a politician or public official without it being torn apart by an army of &#8216;fact-checking&#8217; bloggers, hungry for content. </p>
<p>And yet, I argued back, after camera phone dude helps us establish that the plane has crashed, who can we trust to tell us <em>why</em> it happened? While bloggers can own the first five minutes of any breaking story - a plane crash, a fire, a burglary - it&#8217;s always going to be the professional reporters who own the next five days, or five weeks. They walk the streets, work their contacts and - yes -  trawl the blogosphere for eye-witness reports, and then take all of that information, analyse it, follow it up and ultimately provide an account of events that readers can trust.</p>
<p>Or at least this is what they used to do. If that were still how journalism works then the unpaid bloggers wouldn&#8217;t have a hope of competing. But unfortunately, thanks to a succession of journalistic fakes and the constant tabloidisation of the press, that trust is gone. Why should someone - either an advertiser or a reader - be prepared to pay for a newspaper when they can get the same old lies and fluff from the blogosphere?</p>
<p>As we sat in Los Angeles, debating how to save what remains of professional journalism, Michael Arrington was posting one possible solution on this very blog. In a post titled &#8216;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/what-if-the-new-new-york-times">What If: The New New York Times</a>&#8216; he argued that the New York Times should lay off all but 50 of its reporters, leaving behind the crack team of superstar hacks who truly drive the paper&#8217;s value. These cuts, he said, would allow the remaining reporters to be paid a generous wage for their work, thus solving the twin questions of trust and of how to pay for good journalism in future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice idea, but one that overlooks the fact that a superstar hack takes days - or weeks - of legwork to get to the bottom of a single story. Without content from workaday photographers or wire-feed-re-writers, the New New York Times would be three pages long and published weekly. Good journalism is a slow, labour-intensive business. And what about unglamourous local stories? Let&#8217;s not forget that the two most famous reporters of all time - Woodward and Bernstein - were junior reporters when the broke their most famous story: Watergate. A story, let&#8217;s also not forget, that began life as a dull local burglary. Which of the 50 top flight hacks would have been assigned to that?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t matter how you twist it, there&#8217;s simply no way for the New York Times to regain its position as the news reporter of record in the Internet era. Instead, if Mike really wants to save the Times, while simultaneously seeing the future of journalism, he should look a little closer to home. </p>
<p>To TechCrunch in fact. </p>
<p>Because while TechCrunch might be &#8216;just&#8217; a blog it&#8217;s also, as I&#8217;ve discovered in the past few weeks, a hell of a professional journalistic machine. Whatever the cynics might think, it&#8217;s a place where sources are built up, facts are checked, lawyers are employed and writers are encouraged to go out and get the real story behind the story. It&#8217;s also on something of a hiring spree at the moment - looking out at traditional media and cherry picking those (ahem) who it thinks can bring more value to the brand. In doing so, TechCrunch is one of a handful of tech blogs that commands solid advertising revenues and has - by and large - build up huge trust amongst readers. Trust which allows it to host events like TechCrunch 50, bringing in even more money to support the site&#8217;s journalism.</p>
<p>Right across the Internet there are countless other sites that employ the same standards for other niches - from music (<a href="http://www.pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a>) to politics (<a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a>) to farming (I have no idea) - each of which can afford to dedicate more time to their very specific field of expertise than the New York Times could, even if it doubled its staff.</p>
<p>And so if I were the New York Times, I&#8217;d realise that in the face of such solid niche competition, my days as a news-gatherer were over. I&#8217;d lay off all of my journalists, shut down the presses (a move favoured by Lacy during a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jul/08/journalism-internet-socialmedia-businessmodels">recent Guardian podcast</a>), close the doors and thank God for giving me such a good innings. Then the next day I&#8217;d round up maybe 20 or 30 of my best editors and I&#8217;d launch a brand new site. A site which, like a far more mainstream <a href="http://www.aldaily.com/">Arts and Letters Daily</a>, would use those skilled human editors to aggregate the best specialist reporting from around the web into one all-encompassing news source.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d link to posts on TechCrunch, and Pitchfork and FiveThirtyEight and on any other site that my professional editors had determined was providing the best coverage of each of the days most important stories. And I&#8217;d work hard - really hard - to rebuild my brand credibility so that readers knew that they could absolutely trust the reporting on any site that had been selected by editors. All the news that&#8217;s fit to link.</p>
<p>For the New York Times, the cost in doing all of this would be limited to retaining the 30 best editors in the business, and the small support staff required to keep them productive - costs easily covered thanks to the millions of eyeballs that would visit just such a site every day, hungry for news sources they can actually trust.</p>
<p>For the specialist sites being linked to, the boost in traffic and credibility would only bring more targeted advertising revenue and more possibilities for spin off events, books and the rest, all of which contribute to the journalistic bottom line and their ability to hire from the army of recently unemployed journalists.</p>
<p>And as for the life-casters and amateur bloggers - they can keep having their fun too; contributing user generated content to the niche sites, and then re-parsing the coverage on their own blogs, Twitter stream or - in Scoble&#8217;s case - FriendFeed. It&#8217;s a solution where every one&#8217;s a winner. Except for the life casters, who by and large will remain losers.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no reason the aggregating site has to be created by the New York Times; anyone with some high-level editorial experience could do it. Equally there&#8217;s no reason why there can&#8217;t be dozens of these aggregators, each with their own editorial voice: one for liberals, one for conservatives, one for wealthy Brits, one for college kids in Guatemala. The point is that the days of the profitable generalist news-gatherer are dying, but the days of solid reporting and a strong, trusted editorial voice must never be allowed to perish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a point that&#8217;s so important it kept a group of us arguing until the early hours in Los Angeles, and so important that the possible solution has been bouncing around my head ever since. Hell, it&#8217;s so important that I feel like getting up from my desk right now and hitting the streets looking for the perfect newsman-turned-entrepreneur to make it happen.</p>
<p>If only I wasn&#8217;t on this stupid juice cleanse and hadn&#8217;t lost the use of my legs.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88809" title="picture-32" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-32.png" alt="picture-32" width="328" height="452" />The existence of Apple&#8217;s new so-called &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; music experience being created with the major record labels seemed to create headlines last week more for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/are-apple-and-the-music-labels-mixing-holiday-cocktails-on-the-tablet/">side-talk about the Apple tablet</a>, than the music element itself. And for good reason, because just as we wrote last week, it&#8217;s starting to sound like this is mainly another ploy to pull more money out of consumers&#8217; pockets.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, it&#8217;s also starting to sound like the music industry may be taking a cue from the rise of mobile applications, to position this new format.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE5701KE20090801">Reuters has a new report</a> today about the Cocktail plan. After you wade through the usual PR speak from music execs about how this will change the digital music experience for consumers, you get to the real nugget of information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will the Cocktail format drive greater digital album sales? Probably not, but that&#8217;s not what the music industry is expecting from it. Instead, label sources position it as a way to further monetize existing digital album purchases. While pricing information isn&#8217;t available, Cocktail-formatted albums will almost certainly cost more than the standard album available on iTunes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there something to be said for the missing experience of opening a record or CD for the first time, and checking out things like the artwork? Of course. But if the industry execs really cared about that, they&#8217;d come up with a standard to offer that without jacking up prices on consumers to give them a better experience.</p>
<p>Instead, they have likely come up with a way to charge more for content, while wrapping it in some new marketing. And while the execs and most outlets are mostly pushing the Apple angle specifically, the idea is to get these new types of digital albums to all the big digital music outlets, as Greg Sandoval <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10296045-93.html">reported last week</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s smart to push Apple&#8217;s role in this because it sounds like it is doing things a little differently than what the music labels plan to do with the rest of the outlets. And it seems like a good bet that Apple&#8217;s version could offer a better experience than the others. The reason is that Apple&#8217;s digital content is so tightly integrated with its devices. So something like Cocktail on an iPhone or iPod touch could be a lot nicer than simply trying to run it on a computer or a less capable mobile media player.</p>
<p>And from what&#8217;s being said about all of this, it&#8217;s starting to sound like these Cocktails may actually be album apps of sorts, that you open and interact with while listening to the music. Again, Apple has already proven itself in the app game.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this new format takes off in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, but don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking that the prime motivation for this is anything but a way for the labels to make more money.</p>

<p>Right about now, Apple probably wishes it had never <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected Google Voice</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">related apps</a> from the iPhone.  Or maybe it was AT&#038;T who rejected the apps.  Nobody really knows.  But the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an investigation</a> last night to find out, sending letters to all three companies (Apple, AT&#038;T, and Google) asking them to explain exactly what happened.</p>
<p>On its face, it might seem odd to some people that the FCC is investigating the rejection of a single iPhone app.  After all, iPhone apps are rejected every day.  But the Google Voice rejection caused an unusual amount of <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090727/p90#a090727p90">uproar</a>, and there is nothing like a high-profile case to make an example out of in pursuit of pushing a bigger policy agenda.  The FCC investigation is not just about the arbitrary rejection of a single app.  It is the FCC&#8217;s way of putting a stake in the ground for making the wireless networks controlled by cell phone carriers as open as the Internet.</p>
<p>Today there are two different sets of rules for applications and devices on the Internet.  On the wired Internet, we can connect any type of PC or other computing device and use any applications we want on those devices.  On the wireless Internet controlled by cellular carriers like AT&#038;T, we can only use the phones they allow on their networks and can only use the applications they approve.  This was fine when the wireless networks were used mostly just for voice calls.  But now that they are increasingly becoming our mobile connections to the Internet and mobile phones are becoming full-fledged mobile computers, an argument has been growing that the same rules of open access that rule the wired Internet should apply to the wireless Internet.</p>
<p>While Apple and AT&#038;T cannot be too happy about the FCC investigation, Google must secretly be pleased as punch.  It was only two years ago, prior to the 700MHz wireless spectrum auctions, that it was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">pleading with the FCC</a> to adopt principles guaranteeing open access for applications, devices, services, and other networks. Now two years later, in a different context and under a different administration, the FCC is pushing for the same principles.</p>
<p>In its letters requesting more information from all three companies, the FCC cites &#8220;pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497).  That first proceeding on open access dates back to 2007 when <a href=" http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/02/22/skype-begs-fcc-to-open-cell-networks/">Skype requested</a> that cell phone carriers open up their networks to all applications (see <a href=" http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:WMsHzJyFR6IJ:www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/pisc-skype-comments-20070430.pdf+RM-11361&#038;cd=2&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=us&#038;client=firefox-a">Skype&#8217;s petition here</a>).  Like Google Voice, Skype helps consumers bypass the carriers.  The carriers don&#8217;t like that because it erodes their core business and turns them into dumb pipes.</p>
<p>But dumb pipes are what we need.  They are good for consumers and good for competition because they allow any application and any device, within reason, to flower on the wireless Internet.  So if you look at the questions the FCC is asking, it wants to know why the Google Voice app was rejected and whether AT&#038;T (the carrier) had anything to do with that rejection:</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&#038;T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications? . . . </p>
<p>3. Does AT&#038;T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)?  If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play? </p></blockquote>
<p>The FCC also wants Apple to explain the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">arbitrariness</a> of its app approval process:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone.  Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&#038;T’s 3G network?</p>
<p>5. What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons?  Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers?  If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers?</p>
<p>6. What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications?   What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)?  What is the percentage of applications that are rejected?  What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?</p></blockquote>
<p>Good questions.  Hopefully, the FCC will share Apple&#8217;s answers with the rest of the us.  It is all a bit absurd, though.  Why does it take a formal request from a government agency to get Apple (and AT&#038;T) to explain what the rules are to get on the wireless Internet?  More importantly, why are these companies allowed to be the gatekeepers to the wireless Internet?   The iPhone needs to be smashed open, and the FCC is swinging the hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AT&#038;T responded to this post with the following statements:</p>
<blockquote><p>
AT&#038;T does not manage or approve applications for the App Store. We have received the letter and will, of course, respond to it.</p>
<p>Customers can use any compatible GSM phone on our network, not just the ones we’ve approved and sell.  And they also can use apps we don’t approve.  We don’t approve iPhone applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. You can use any mobile app you like on AT&#038;T—unless it is an iPhone app (that&#8217;s been rejected by Apple).  Does Apple ever reject apps at the request of AT&#038;T though?  Maybe they&#8217;ll give the FCC a straight answer.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr-215x141.jpg" width="215" height="141" />Ever since I've started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I've been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it's not getting any better. 

It's not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.

When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given 'best practice' and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr.jpg" class="shot2" />Ever since I&#8217;ve started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I&#8217;ve been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it&#8217;s not getting any better. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.</p>
<p>When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given &#8216;best practice&#8217; and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible. Regular TechCrunch readers know <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/04/the-reality-of-pr-smile-dial-name-drop-pray/">how we think about the PR industry</a> - and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/lois-whitman-now-an-unwilling-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-pr/">some of its proponents</a> - in today&#8217;s world, and in particular <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/">our stance towards embargoes</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle a different problem in this post, one that reporters from around the world, whatever field they cover, will no doubt recognize. The issue I have with press releases, and the reason I think they are a thing of the distant past in their current form, is that they basically all look alike. Sure, the companies that are talked about can be different, and the type of news coming from them can be different, but the copy, form and style are often so much alike that for large parts of the announcements you could just as easily swap the names of the companies and keep the rest of the words. Oftentimes, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with press releases is that for basically as long as they&#8217;ve been around, they&#8217;ve contained the same damn words, rendering them completely meaningless in most cases and contexts. I wonder what the world would be like if these words were henceforth permanently banned from all press releases:</p>
<p><strong>1 ) LEADING / LEADER</strong></p>
<p>You know the kind: <em>&#8220;Initech, the leading blah in blah blah blah, has partnered with Initrode, leader in blah blah blahblah blah blah blah.&#8221;</em> Every single time a press release carries either one of these words in the first sentence, I cringe. Why? Because if everyone is leading, no one is. Period. PR people, next time you start writing a news announcement, ask yourself if you really should be using the words &#8216;leading&#8217; or &#8216;leader&#8217; just because it&#8217;s easy and everyone is doing it.</p>
<p><strong>2 ) BEST / MOST / FASTEST / LARGEST / BIGGEST / etc.</strong></p>
<p>Emphasizing the strengths of the company you&#8217;re pitching is obviously a good thing. But does anyone realize how meaningless these terms become when they are followed up by something so blatantly untrue or tied to a small niche that it&#8217;s just painful to read? I&#8217;m specifically thinking about press releases that commence with something like <em>&#8220;Initech, the largest manufacturer of red staplers engraved with our company logo, has just won the Buzo Award for the most uncreative use of the word &#8216;largest&#8217; in the history of mankind.&#8221;</em> Handle these words with care.</p>
<p><strong>3 ) INNOVATIVE / INNOVATION</strong></p>
<p>The mother of all voidness. How many truly innovative products are launched on a yearly basis, regardless of the sector? How many times have you seen something get the &#8216;innovation&#8217; label without merit? Unless you or your clients find a cure for all cancers, simply stop using it, starting today. Now that would be innovative.</p>
<p><strong>4 ) REVOLUTIONARY</strong></p>
<p>Much like the above, terrible word to be using in press releases. What exactly about your product is going to make people leave their houses to demonstrate, oppose their government, riot, etc.? Oh, sorry, you mean the company you&#8217;re pitching is not going to change the world but it is going to completely change the way an industry thinks about your business? Safe bet: it&#8217;s not going to. Likely you&#8217;re just doing the old &#8216;wishful thinking&#8217; routine, and everyone knows you are.</p>
<p><strong>5 ) AWARD-WINNING</strong></p>
<p>Trust me, telling anyone willing to listen that you&#8217;ve been recognized with this or that award won&#8217;t be providing you with any goodwill right off the bat. There are exceptions to this rule, but very few (they include the Nobel Prize, a Pulitzer, a <a href="http://crunchies2008.techcrunch.com/">Crunchie</a> or a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/announcing-the-europas-the-techcrunch-europe-awards-2009/">Europa Award</a>). Basically it&#8217;s like going around a party informing everyone that you&#8217;ve had sex with a human being last week: I&#8217;m sure it matters to you a great deal - and hopefully to the other person as well - but the rest of us likely don&#8217;t give a hoot. We also think it&#8217;s kind of sad that you are looking for someone to confirm or recognize your accomplishments that way. A tip: unless you&#8217;re announcing that you&#8217;ve actually won an award (which by the way is only very rarely newsworthy), leave it out.</p>
<p><strong>6 ) DISRUPTIVE / DISRUPTION</strong></p>
<p>Newsflash: a product or service is only very, very, very rarely disruptive. If there is a truly ground-breaking one, it&#8217;s also never disruptive out of the gate, for it can take years or even decades to turn an entire industry upside down. The fact that you&#8217;d use the word in a press release speaks volumes about your ability to tell your head from your ass: anything truly disruptive doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and you can&#8217;t capture &#8216;disruption&#8217; in a news announcement pushed out at a given time and date. Besides, if something is genuinely disruptive I&#8217;m sure it will require little push from PR people or firms to get the word out there.</p>
<p><strong>7 ) CUTTING / BLEEDING EDGE</strong></p>
<p>In the same boat as the words &#8216;innovative&#8217;, &#8216;revolutionary&#8217; and &#8216;disruptive&#8217;: so often misused in the past that it now looks like you&#8217;re practicing your skills to write quality satire when you use it to tout a company or product in a press release. </p>
<p><strong>8 ) NEXT-GENERATION</strong></p>
<p>Overused. If you have an updated version of your product to announce, why not just say so? I simply cannot understand what people are trying to tell me when they say their new release is &#8216;next-gen&#8217;. Is it too advanced or complex for me to use and will only young children have the ability to understand what you&#8217;re doing when they grow up? Did your previous product version stink so bad that you needed to skip an entire generation of iterations to finally get it right?</p>
<p><strong>9 ) STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>Partnering with other companies can be good - and newsworthy too, though not often - but it doesn&#8217;t help you get more attention or goodwill when you announce a <em>strategic</em> partnership, agreement or relationship. We&#8217;re assuming it fits in both your strategy and the one of the company or companies you team up with, otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be forming an alliance, right? It&#8217;s not like your agreement suddenly gets a whole other dimension because it&#8217;s labeled &#8217;strategic&#8217;, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>10 ) SYNERGY</strong></p>
<p>Simply defined, synergy means that the whole in combination is greater than the sum of the individual parts working on their own. Used properly, the word can describe the magnified effects of two drugs taken together, parasites that enforce each other’s destructive effects and compounded health risks due to toxic chemicals. When applied to corporations, it means a financial benefit that a company aims to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation. As history teaches us, there’s rarely any synergy involved when companies melt together or one takes over the other (cough, AOL-Time Warner). PR people, you’d be doing yourself a serious favor banning this one from all future press releases.</p>
<p>Bonus words: enterprise-grade, world-class, turnkey, premier, unparalleled and unrivaled.</p>
<p>Can you think of any others that should be given the kibosh? </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> awesome! <a href="http://www.davidmeermanscott.com/documents/3703Gobbledygook.pdf">The Gobbledygook Manifesto</a> (PDF) by <a href="http://www.davidmeermanscott.com/products_ebooks.htm">David Meerman Scott</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you have links to press releases that are ridden with the terms I&#8217;ve grown so resentful of, do let me know in comments. I&#8217;ll help you get started with this one about Akamai and Delve Networks&#8217; recent forming of a <a href="http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=ind_focus.story&#038;STORY=/www/story/07-31-2009/0005069827&#038;EDATE=">strategic partnership</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Delve Networks, a <strong>leading</strong> provider of video platforms, announces a <strong>strategic relationship</strong> with Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKAM), the <strong>leader</strong> in powering rich media, dynamic transactions and enterprise applications online, that will enable Delve to offer customers a comprehensive and <strong>innovative</strong> video publishing solution that includes video management and delivery including support of <strong>next generation</strong> variable bit rate streaming technologies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we&#8217;ve been tracking the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/chrome-for-mac-starting-to-look-polished/">progress</a> of Google Chrome on the Mac for a while. The daily <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/">builds</a> of Chromium seem to be getting better and better, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/02/chrome-for-mac-coming-along-fine/">close</a> to being ready for prime time. One major thing missing however has been the lack of Adobe Flash support in the browser. Well, don&#8217;t look now, but it&#8217;s finally working — kind of.</p>
<p>Okay, to be honest, you can&#8217;t pause or stop Flash videos on sites like YouTube, but the important part is that when you click on a YouTube link, the videos actually play. That is great. I&#8217;m very, very close to using Chrome for the Mac on a daily basis already, and this may have just put me over the edge of at least using it as a secondary browser.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re getting very close to a release of Chrome for the Mac that is stable enough for regular web surfers to use. If the team has implemented Flash support, I have to believe that they are close to where they want to be in terms of a general release schedule. Of course, they have already released developer versions of the browser for the Mac, but they encouraged people <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/google-releases-dev-version-of-chrome-for-mac-and-linux-but-it-doesnt-want-you-to-use-it/">not to use them</a>. I think soon that mentality may change, and we may see a public beta.</p>

We&#8217;ve obtained copies of the letters and reprinted them below.</p>
<p>The newswire report notes that this is part of the FCC&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/18/AR2009061803814.html">investigation</a> into wireless handsets and their exclusive deals with carriers.  Of course, this all comes <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">years</a> after Google CEO Eric Schmidt sent a letter to the FCC, urging it to adopt open standards that would gives users the freedom to use whichever applications they&#8217;d like on their wireless devices, on whichever network they preferred.  At the time the suggestions seemed perhaps a bit idealistic, but now it&#8217;s becoming clear just how badly they&#8217;re needed.</p>
<p>It has been just over one year since Apple released the App Store, and already we&#8217;re beginning to see just what can happen when major companies collude to restrict user choice without fear of recourse.  As I&#8217;ve written before, Google Voice offers a service that innovates in the telephony space in a way that hasn&#8217;t been seen for years.  But rather than try to improve and offer a better service, Apple and AT&#038;T are doing what they can do to protect their sacred cash cow.  But it looks like the government isn&#8217;t going to stand for that any longer.  With this move, the FCC is showing that it&#8217;s not going to let Apple carry its famed culture of secrecy into the telecom space.</p>

<p>RE: Google Voice and related iPhone applications</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Novelli:</p>
<p>Recent press reports indicate that Apple has declined to approve the Google Voice application for the iPhone and has removed related (and previously approved) third-party applications from the iPhone App Store.   In light of pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497), we are interested in a more complete understanding of this situation.</p>
<p>To that end, please provide answers to the following questions by close of business on Friday, August 21, 2009.</p>
<p>1.	Why did Apple reject the Google Voice application for iPhone and remove related third-party applications from its App Store?  In addition to Google Voice, which related third-party applications were removed or have been rejected?  Please provide the specific name of each application and the contact information for the developer.<br />
2.	Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&#038;T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications?  If the latter, please describe the communications between Apple and AT&#038;T in connection with the decision to reject Google Voice.  Are there any contractual conditions or non-contractual understandings with AT&#038;T that affected Apple’s decision in this matter?<br />
3.	Does AT&#038;T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)?  If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play?  What roles are specified in the contractual provisions between Apple and AT&#038;T (or any non-contractual understandings) regarding the consideration of particular iPhone applications?<br />
4.	Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone.  Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&#038;T’s 3G network?<br />
5.	What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons?  Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers?  If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers?<br />
6.	What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications?   What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)?  What is the percentage of applications that are rejected?  What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?</p>
<p>Request for Confidential Treatment.  If Apple requests that any information or documents responsive to this letter be treated in a confidential manner, it shall submit, along with all responsive information and documents, a statement in accordance with section 0.459 of the Commission&#8217;s rules.  47 C.F.R. § 0.459.  Requests for confidential treatment must comply with the requirements of section 0.459, including the standards of specificity mandated by section 0.459(b).  Accordingly, “blanket” requests for confidentiality of a large set of documents are unacceptable.  Pursuant to section 0.459(c), the Bureau will not consider requests that do not comply with the requirements of section 0.459.</p>

Last November a company called <a href="http://www.leader.com/">Leader Technologies</a>, which makes business communcation tools, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/11/19/patent-troll-lopes-after-facebook/">filed suit</a> against Facebook alleging that the social network had infringed on a patent that "relates to a method and system for the management and storage of electronic information."  The case is still ongoing, and it sounds like it has some legs — earlier this week Facebook was <a href="http://www.realgeek.com/facebook-ordered-to-give-leader-its-source-code/">ordered</a> by a Magistrate Judge from the District of Delaware's District Court to give Leader Technologies access to its entire source code.  As <a href="http://ip.law360.com/articles/113744">reported</a> at Law360, Facebook has until the end of this week to hand over a hierarchical map of the source, and has until August 21st to share its entire codebase with the company.

Of course, Facebook is going to fight tooth and nail against this, and is sure to appeal the ruling.  

Facebook has given us the following statement regarding the case:

<blockquote>While we respect the magistrate judge’s opinion, we disagree with it on this point and plan to appeal.  Generally, this suit is without merit and we will continue to fight it aggressively.

Image search is an area of intense competition between Google, Yahoo, and now Bing.  Today, <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> added some <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/search-options-now-on-google-images.html">search options</a> to make it easier to filter a search by color, type (face, photo, clip art, line drawing), and file size.  

Most of these filters were available before in advanced search, but now they are available in the left-hand column.  (A similar option column was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/google-launches-search-options-declares-real-time-search-biggest-challenge/">introduced</a> to the main search page in May, 2009).  You can choose more than one option to automatically narrow down your search.  Another option Google could add is sorting by images with a Creative Commons license.  It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/google-finally-adds-creative-commons-to-image-search/">already does this in its advanced search options</a>, but it is hidden there.  ]]></description>

<p>Image search is an area of intense competition between Google, Yahoo, and now Bing.  Today, <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> added some <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/search-options-now-on-google-images.html">search options</a> to make it easier to filter a search by color, type (face, photo, clip art, line drawing), and file size.  </p>
<p>Most of these filters were available before in advanced search, but now they are available in the left-hand column.  (A similar option column was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/google-launches-search-options-declares-real-time-search-biggest-challenge/">introduced</a> to the main search page in May, 2009).  You can choose more than one option to automatically narrow down your search.  Another option Google could add is sorting by images with a Creative Commons license.  It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/google-finally-adds-creative-commons-to-image-search/">already does this in its advanced search options</a>, but it is hidden there.  </p>
<p>Yahoo and Bing have similar filtering options, Although Google&#8217;s color filter is the most advanced. It allows you to sort by 12 different colors, wheras Bing and Yahoo only let you sort by color or black-and-white images.  Bing, however, does a better job with related searches, something Google is experimenting with in a slightly different way by actually trying to find <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/google-similar-images-first-look/" similar images.</a> And Yahoo has its </a><a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/sightsee-without-leaving-yahoo-image-search/">own set of novel features</a> in image search which Google doesn&#8217;t.  You can compare the three with a search for &#8220;fruit&#8221; on <a href="http://images.google.com/images?imgcolor=&#038;imgtbs=&#038;gbv=2&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=1&#038;q=fruit&#038;btnG=Search+images&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=&#038;aqi=&#038;start=0">Google Images</a>, <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0WTefOac3NKdvEArFyLuLkF?p=fruit&#038;ei=utf-8&#038;iscqry=&#038;fr=sfp">Yahoo Images</a>, and <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fruit&#038;FORM=BIFD">Bing Images</a>.</p>

I remember where I was when it hit: On my way to Napa Valley with some friends as we heard sirens race by, likely signaling the end of the Twitter world as we knew it.</p>
<p>Okay, it didn&#8217;t end up being <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/12/twitpocalypse-not-now-crisis-averted/">that bad</a>. But it still was a pain in the ass for many third-party developers, especially the iPhone Twitter app developers, who had to wait in the App Store line like everyone else for their fixes to go through. And now it&#8217;s set to happen all over again!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/3059191420">A tweet</a> today from the TwitterAPI account warned that the second Twitpocalypse was closer than people thought. Okay, most people probably didn&#8217;t realize that it could occur again, but it can, and it will, and it&#8217;s fast approaching.</p>
<p>The <a href="Twitter status ids are fast approaching the maximum 32-bit *unsigned* ">current estimate</a> by the API team is that it will occur sometime in the next 60 days, probably at the end of September. They warn that it could happen sooner though.</p>
<p>So what does it mean, and why is it happening? Well, for those that don&#8217;t remember, the first Twitpocalypse occurred when the unique identifier for tweets hit 2,147,483,647 — the 32-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29">signed integer</a> limit. That number caused some third-party apps to start counting tweet identifiers as negative, screwing them up. This new Twitpocalpyse is similar, only it&#8217;s for the 32-bit <em>unsigned</em> integer value of 4,294,967,295.</p>
<p>In case you didn&#8217;t already realize it, the fact that this chasm between the two numbers was crossed so quickly once again shows that Twitter is growing very quickly. Though it&#8217;s not a 1 to 1 tweet-to-unique ID ratio, that the number will have doubled (an increase of over 2 billion) in just a few months is huge.</p>
<p>So what can you do to prepare yourself? Well the Twitter API team recommends developing your apps to use 64-bit integers, thus increasingly the number of tweets your app can recognize before it hits these integer walls.</p>
<p>Also, lock up the women and children.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the transcript:</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Microsoft and Yahoo! announced yesterday a partnership in the search and advertising business.  Under the deal, Yahoo!`s websites will be powered by Microsoft new search engine, Bing.  Yahoo! will get 88 percent of the ad revenue from searches on its sites for the first five years.  With the partnership, the two hope to take on Google, which currently commands about 65 percent share of the U.S. market.  The agreement follows Microsoft`s failed takeover bid for Yahoo! and shows the continuing importance it is placing on search.</p>
<p>Joining me now from Redmond, Washington, is Nick Wingfield of the &#8220;Wall Street Journal.&#8221;  Here in New York with me, Steven Levy of &#8220;Wired&#8221; magazine and Erick Schonfeld, co-editor of TechCrunch blog.  I am pleased to have all of them here.</p>
<p>Nick, tell me how this deal happened, first.</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  It started last year with the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, making an unsolicited bid for close to $48 billion to acquire Yahoo!.  Never happened, Yahoo! resisted the offer.  It fell apart.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about January.  Yahoo! has a new CEO, Carol Bartz, and Microsoft and Yahoo! start talking about a more limited deal, not a full-blown acquisition, in which Microsoft basically take over the search operations, handle the search operations on Yahoo! in exchange for some value.  And the deal went through all sorts of fits and starts, and finally arrived at the deal you described a moment ago.</p>
<p>All of this being designed to improve Microsoft`s fairly poor position in search right now, which is a highly lucrative market, the online advertising market that accompanies search, and one that Microsoft really has not had much success in on its own.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is this a good deal for just Microsoft or good deal for Microsoft and Yahoo!?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, the shareholders of both companies seem to think it`s a better deal for Microsoft than it is for Yahoo!  The stock of Microsoft went up a bit yesterday and up a bit today.  Yahoo! is down.</p>
<p>One of the problems Yahoo! has is that they had sort of almost set expectation that they were going to get a big check, a multi-billion dollar check from Microsoft in exchange for a deal of this sort.  And that didn`t end up happening.  Instead, what Yahoo! is getting is very high percentage of the ad revenue from advertising sold on searches that Microsoft delivers.  So, both parties argue that it`s better for Yahoo! to get this, because they`re getting more &#8212; a bigger chunk of the share of ad revenue on an ongoing basis, but there is no big upfront check, and that seems to disappoint people.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So, what`s the judgment of people who are looking at it in terms of whether Yahoo! would have been better to take the original deal that Ballmer offered or take the deal they have now?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, I don`t think there`s any question that Yahoo! shareholders would be better off if they had accepted the original $48 billion deal.  I don`t know what Yahoo!`s latest market capitalization is, but they`re down a lot.</p>
<p>So, I don`t think Microsoft, though, regrets not acquiring all of Yahoo!  I think they`re fairly happy with the position that they`re in.  They also have managed to improve their own home-grown search engine, which is now called Bing, and have started to inch up a little bit in market share.  So I think Microsoft probably comes out a little bit ahead here, but still, both parties argue that Yahoo! is going to thrive as well because they no longer have to invest in search, so they can be a lot more profitable.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is this going to work?</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  It has a lot of hurdles.  I think the upfront money really isn`t the key to Yahoo!  The key is, Yahoo! is disbanding their search team, their engineering, and disbanding the team which built their advertising engine to sell ads on search.  Now, these happen to be some of the most important aspects of engineering at a company there.  And really, if Yahoo! wants to be a top Internet company, it has to have the engineering chops to keep doing that.</p>
<p>So, it`s going to miss out on that.  And it will save money by not hiring &#8212; having those people to pay, but those are the people you want in your company.</p>
<p>Also, this deal is a little complicated.  Yahoo! actually is going to sell some of these ads to the premium customers.  A lot of customers, those in the long tail, they just go on the website and buy the ads just straight there like you buy something from Amazon.  But a big customer needs someone to work with them and tell them what words to buy.  It`s very complicated in how much to bid, because these things are all done by bids.  And Yahoo! is doing that part, and Microsoft has the technology, which means those people who work for Yahoo! are really going to have to go back and forth to Redmond and talk to a lot of people to be familiar with how that works there.  So there`s a little complication in how they`re going to be able to do that, which is going to make it a little more difficult for Microsoft`s big task, which is to take on Google and build up its ad share to something beyond even what it has combined with Yahoo!</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Did Bing make a difference here at all, the fact that Bing has gotten &#8212; the Microsoft search engine has gotten good reviews?</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  I think Bing made a big difference, because Yahoo! was in a tough position.  It was seeing market share eroding from the top, from Google, and now the prospect of market share erosion from the bottom, from Bing.  Bing has only been out for two months, but it`s made a little bit of a gain in share, .4 percent.  Is that going to last over time? Who knows.  But Yahoo! didn`t want to find out.  Right?</p>
<p>And the big problem here is that Yahoo! really &#8212; they kind of walked away from the most interesting fight on the Internet right now, which is search.  And they handed it over to Microsoft for less than any of the previous deals that were on the table.  The four real deals that were on the table going back to the $45 or $48 billion offer in February of 2008, the revised search deal that Microsoft offered, which included $8 billion to buy 16 percent of Yahoo! and $1 billion payment for the search part of the business.  The Google deal that got squashed, that guaranteed $800 million in revenues.</p>
<p>This deal was the worst of all the deals.  And as Steve mentions, the deal introduces a lot of complexity, right?  So now you`re going to have Yahoo! sales people selling Microsoft`s search product.  So Yahoo! sales people already have enough problem talking to Yahoo! engineers.  Now they have to talk to Microsoft engineers.  And what if something goes wrong? Who are they going to yell at?  Are the Microsoft engineers going to like that, being yelled at by Yahoo! sales people?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Nick, you`re in Redmond.  What does this do for Steve Ballmer?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, it gives him a real fighting chance in a market that he said is strategic to the company.  They have about 8.4 percent market share on their own with Bing.  With Yahoo!`s market share, they could go to 30 percent of shares &#8212; 30 percent of searches in the U.S., and that`s significant.</p>
<p>Now the question is, does it decline from there? Can they increase it?  If they do that, you know, how much money do they make off of it?  Because of course, Microsoft is losing money in its Internet search business right now.  But they just want to gain the share.  They argue once they gain the share, they get eyeballs.  Search is a scale business, that they will start to improve the quality of the search, because they can do all sorts of things, make ads more relevant.  And if they do that, they think they can have a flywheel effect and start really eating into Google`s share.</p>
<p>The other thing that this lets them do is, Google is not only strong in search with 65 percent plus share, but Google is also moving into these other areas that are quite threatening to Microsoft.  They`re using their profits in search to get into operating systems, into online applications that are free, that threaten these cash-cow businesses like Office and Word and Excel.  And they just recently announced that they`re going to be doing an operating system for laptops.  They already have one for mobile phones.  And I think Microsoft wants to gain share in search in part to help alleviate that threat.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And what about the leadership of Yahoo!?  Carol Bartz?</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  Well, she felt she had to do something.  But I think in this case, by targeting the search team and taking it away, some people wonder whether that`s going to really take the glue, which keeps her portal together there.</p>
<p>The search that Yahoo! did had, you know, about three times the size of what Microsoft search, mainly because so many people come to Yahoo! and they search there.  So it really was an opportunity for Yahoo! to grow out there and do more.</p>
<p>She says this is going to enable them to concentrate on the other things that they do.  But having a very strong search team and engineering that comes with that search, and with the really complicated engineering you have to do to be able to sell ads on searches, that`s very complex.  And you know, for reasons we can get into, it really helps if your share grows.  Not having that, those engineers aren`t going to be able to filter through the rest of the company to help you do these other things there.  If you look at the team now, gee, what are they going to do?  It`s going to take well over a year for this to come to fruition with this deal there.  So if I`m working as an engineer for Yahoo! now, what`s my future?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  That`s &#8212; and losing talent is the big issue so much, because they`re creating the new software and building on the old.</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  And who is one of the most talented people at Microsoft, the one they all talk about there, is Qi Lu, the guy who came from Yahoo!, and went to Microsoft.  He`s now the big technology leader, the bright guy who is leading Microsoft search.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  All right.  What about AOL? What`s going to happen to AOL?</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  So, I think AOL is a great example here, because you`ve got Tim Armstrong, who came from Google, who is now the new CEO of AOL, and he took what was really a hobbled company, and is taking it in a new direction, away from the sweet spot that Google or Yahoo! or Microsoft already dominate in.  He`s hiring hundreds of journalists, which as you know from your Politico piece, that you know, they are very, very valuable assets.  And is kind of creating &#8212; that`s just one part of his business &#8212; is creating this sort of new newsstand online.  And is doing a lot of interesting things.</p>
<p>And so why didn`t Carol Bartz do that?  Why didn`t she double down?  You can make the argument that you know, ultimately she had to do something, because she doesn`t have Microsoft`s Windows money and she doesn`t have Google`s search money.  So ultimately search is an expensive game and maybe she has to get out of that business, ultimately.</p>
<p>But Microsoft needs her search volume.  Why not double down, invest in search, and get a better deal down the line?  Or merge with AOL when they become public?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Speaking of one final issue, anti-trust, Nick.  Is Google worried about anti-trust ramifications of its market share?  Will this deal be subject to anti-trust implications, questions?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, Google is I think worried, yes, about their future in anti-trust.  In this particular case of Microsoft and Yahoo!, they argue that together they have 30 percent of the market, compared to Google`s 65 percent.  And so they think they are going to have a pretty strong case with the anti-trust regulators.  They are definitely going to face some tough scrutiny.  They`re prepared, I think, to really fight with Google, but it`s unclear what Google is going to do.  There was some talk today at this Microsoft meeting I was at of Google employing sort of third-party advocacy groups to fight the deal.  But Google really is the big gorilla here.  So it`s a little challenging for them to make an argument that this is going to be anti-competitive.  Google has…</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  There`s a really delicious irony here, because last year, when there was the threat of Microsoft buying Yahoo!, Google wanted to make a deal with Yahoo! for the search.  It was not on the scale of this, and Microsoft complained about it, and said to the Justice Department, successfully argued that, hey, we can`t do this, because Yahoo! would end its search team.  There would be less competition in there.  Guess what?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  They`ll take over their search team.  Yes.</p>
<p>Is there a feeling with the search &#8212; Bing getting good marks and now this deal, that Microsoft is back and that Microsoft can deliver a lot more than people, or may be much stronger than people assumed it was, say six months ago, when the effort to buy Yahoo! came to nothing?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, there definitely is a feeling that they are on an upswing in terms of the quality of their products.  Windows 7 is coming out, which they hope will erase the sort of disdain of Windows Vista, which was a very troubled operating system for them with some technical problems.  Bing is doing well.  They have done some innovative stuff in games.  But they`ve also got some real challenges.  For example, some people think that they have placed too much emphasis on search and neglected mobile phones.  They have a pretty poor offering there.  And Apple`s got the iPhone and others are doing very well in that category.  So they`ve got some big challenges in other areas as well.</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  Microsoft no doubt is better off today in search than it was before.  But we shouldn`t overestimate what their advantage is.  Even if they have 30 percent of the search market share, they don`t have 30 percent of the revenues, because they`re giving 88 percent of that back to Yahoo!</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Exactly.  Nick Wingfield, &#8220;Wall Street Journal&#8221; here.  Erick Schonfeld from TechCrunch and Steve Levy from &#8220;Wired,&#8221; thank you all.</p>

Which countries are the worst greenhouse gas emitters?  Now you can see for yourself on this <a href="http://maps.unfccc.int/di/map/">handy Google Map</a> created by a department of the UN and Google.  The map shows changes in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2006.  Green is good (a decrease in emissions) and purple is bad (an increase).

So who are the worst offenders?  Topping the list is Sweden!  The country has managed to increase its emissions by 110 percent over that time period.  So much for Nordic purity.  Following Sweden is Turkey (with a 103 percent increase) and Canada (with a 55 percent increase).  Yes, Canada.  What is it with these northern countries?]]></description>

<p>You&#8217;d think the U.S. would top the list, but it is actually only the tenth worst country with a 14 percent increase in emissions (still well within purple territory).  It is kind of embarrassing that Russia is greener than we are.  But at least we are better than Canada (and Sweden).</p>
<p>Or are we?  The map itself lets you drill down into the data to find out.  You can sort by industry, type of emission (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc), or year, and if click on a country it gives you a detailed breakdown of emissions by economic sector and other variables.  For instance, over the 1990 to 2006 time span, Russia has actually seen a 29 percent decrease in emissions, but if you look at <a href="http://maps.unfccc.int/di/map/?year=2006&#038;gas=Aggregate_GHGs&#038;sector=to">just 2006</a>, Russia starts getting pretty purple, and rises to the No. 3 worst emitter.  And the USA rises to No. 1.  </p>
<p>Hey, we&#8217;re No. 1!</p>

<strong>Background Info:</strong> The Twin Cities denotes the capital city of St. Paul, MN and the larger, more cosmopolitan city of Minneapolis, MN. Together the two cities are home to roughly 2.5 million people.

There's always been a friendly little rivalry going on between the two cities, with some people from Minneapolis viewing people from St. Paul as more blue-collar and rough-around-the-edges, while some from St. Paul think people from Minneapolis are yuppies. I've lived in both cities and they're both nice places. Overall, the rivalry is pretty silly, but it's there. Look hard enough in any city, though, and you'll find both a-holes and nice people. No different in the Twin Cities. Everyone's pretty nice, overall, though.]]></description>

The recession in online advertising, which began in the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/01/the-online-ad-recession-is-officially-here-first-quarterly-decline-in-revenues/">first quarter of 2009</a>, continued into the second. Every quarter we keep track of the combined advertising revenues of the four largest Web advertising companies (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/17/how-google-made-its-q2-numbers-squeezing-expenses/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/yahoos-revenues-drop-13-percent-in-second-quarter-announces-5-percent-of-employees-to-lose-jobs/">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/microsofts-money-pit-every-dollar-of-online-revenue-is-wiped-out-by-a-dollar-of-loss/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/the-hangover-time-warners-q2-results-feature-a-lot-of-goodbye-aol-talk/">AOL</a>), which together represent the lion's share of all online advertising revenues and is a decent proxy for the market as a whole.  In the second quarter of 2009, their combined global ad revenues were $7.864 billion, down 3.4 percent from a year ago.

In economics, a general rule of thumb is that two down quarters marks a recession.  Last quarter saw the first annual decline in advertising revenues of 2.1 percent. And the annual decline this quarter got a little worse.  However, on a sequential basis compared to last quarter, it is actually pretty much flat (but still down 0.18 percent).  So we now have two down quarters on both an annual and sequential basis.  

Will this recession continue into the current quarter, or did we just witness a fundamental <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/24/microsoft-steve-ballmer-cannes">"reset"</a>, as Steve Ballmer likes to call it. ]]></description>

And the annual decline this quarter got a little worse.  However, on a sequential basis compared to last quarter, it is actually pretty much flat (but still down 0.18 percent).

<p>Will this recession continue into the current quarter, or did we just witness a fundamental <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/24/microsoft-steve-ballmer-cannes">&#8220;reset&#8221;</a>, as Steve Ballmer likes to call it.  What that implies is that advertising revenues have been reset to a lower level from which they can once again grow.  We&#8217;ll see what happens in the third quarter, but anecdotally I am hearing from advertising startups that the worst is behind us.  </p>
<p>This may be wishful thinking, of course.  But barring any new economic catastrophe, the advertising levels of the past two quarters seems like the new floor.  But how long will it take to get up off that floor?</p>
<p>These numbers represent global advertising revenues, and include network revenues paid to affiliates through AdSense and Yahoo’s ad network.  Google’s licensing revenues for Google Enterprise Apps have been stripped out.  For the other companies, we include only the advertising portions of their online revenues as reported in their quarterly earnings statements.</p>

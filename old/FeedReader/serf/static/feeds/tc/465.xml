				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/iphoneshot11-95x200.png" width="95" height="200" />Facebook has submitted v. 3.0 of their iPhone application to Apple, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> says <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/3341544620">via</a> Twitter: <em>"Just uploaded Facebook for iPhone 3.0 to the App Store for review. :)"</em>

Hewitt also says he'll post screen shots and more detais on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6628568379">this</a> Facebook page for the iPhone app next week, and that he's looking forward to getting started on v. 3.1 tomorrow.

We've been tracking 3.0 since details first became available in July. A list of some of the much needed improvements <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/details-on-the-upcoming-new-facebook-iphone-app-now-with-events/">is here</a>. And as a bonus, Hewitt said he'd be able to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">include video uploads</a> to Facebook from iPhone 3Gs phones as well.

<blockquote><p>That means that shortly, we’ll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook’s site, the ability to “like” items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have video support for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly. And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s likely Apple will approve this app in short order. Not only are they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/15/phil-schiller-is-a-man-on-a-mission-to-save-the-app-store/">trying to avoid</a> high profile app problems, there&#8217;s also not very much in the Facebook app that they or AT&#038;T would take exception to.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard it, make sure to listen to our <a href="http://www.talkcrunch.com/2007/08/23/interview-with-joe-hewitt-iphone-god/">interview with Joe Hewitt</a> two years ago when Facebook first launched a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/15/facebook-iphone-ultrahype/">special browser-based version of Facebook</a> for the iPhone.</p>

 AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.

<p><em>This guest post was written by <strong>Alex Ahlund</strong>, founder of <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee</a>.</em></p>
<p>We are just past of a year since the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/">App Store launched</a> and there are more than 60,000 applications released for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  When we wrote our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/31/a-look-at-some-of-the-best-iphone-apps-of-2008/">2008 year-end app wrap-up</a>, we had just surpassed the 10,000 app milestone.  In early June 2009, the store reached <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/40-million-iphones-and-ipod-touches-and-50000-apps/">50,000 apps</a>.  At present, we are looking at a staggering 300 new applications being released every single day.  How does the average iPhone user find the gems in this deluge?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process is entirely overwhelming for the average iPhone user.  The bulk of consumers use iTunes’ Top and front page listings.  Since placement on the top lists is derived entirely from unit sales, there is a disturbing skew towards the $.99 applications.  This not only discourages big developers from putting high budgets and serious resources towards development of really useful applications and games, but also does a disservice to us, as iPhone users.  If all we see are ninety-nine cent gimmicks and toys, how will we realize the true potential of our device?  Apple attempts to offset this with editor’s picks, but this simply isn’t enough to make sense of the App Store.</p>
<p>There are new third party services and tools coming onto the scene to help show how to best navigate the App Store.  AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.</p>
<p>The following is a round-up of our top picks so far this year:</p>
<p><strong>Most practical</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-slacker-radio">Slacker Radio</a></strong></p>
<p>A fantastic alternative to Pandora, which carries a larger catalog and offers Premium accounts that offers something we’ve always loathed about Pandora – unlimited song skips. (Similar: <a href="http://www.pandora.com/on-the-iphone">Pandora</a>, <a href="http://www.wunderradio.com/">WunderRadio</a>, <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>)</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/lPFdmjR30kM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lPFdmjR30kM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object><strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-hey-where-are-you"></a></strong></p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-hey-where-are-you">Hey Where Are You</a></strong><br />
A beautifully simple application that takes advantage of Push Notification, by letting users ask and answer the question “Hey, Where Are You?” (Similar: <a href="http://www.loopt.com">Loopt</a>)</p>
<p>3. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-textfree-unlimited">Textfree Unlimited</a></strong><br />
Currently the best alternative to high SMS plan costs, offering free text messaging using Push Notification.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/S4hiEGo9Hv4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/S4hiEGo9Hv4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>4. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/bento">Bento</a></strong><br />
Create simple databases to store information about every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>5. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a></strong><br />
Our new, favorite Twitter client that takes advantage of the same layout as its desktop counterpart – multiple columns, separation of user groups, and more. (Similar: Tweetie, Twinkle, TwitterFON)</p>
<p>6. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-print-and-share">Print and Share</a></strong><br />
Print files, emails, web pages, contacts, images and even snapshots direct from your camera, straight to your home printer.  Simple setup and works perfectly.</p>
<p>7. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-flight-tracker-pro">Flight Tracker</a></strong><br />
Watch flights in real-time and get up-to-the-minute arrival and departure times.  This has saved me countless delayed pick-ups from the airport.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/5Gr_hG3t1zE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5Gr_hG3t1zE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>8. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/read-it-later">Read It Later</a></strong><br />
Store any web page for offline reading or to mark as a reminder to read.  A bit tricky to setup at first, but it will quickly replace bookmarking for articles.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/dlKua91ix28&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dlKua91ix28&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>9. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iEmoji">iEmoji</a></strong><br />
Activate emoticons in your keyboard to include in emails and text messages.  Works only for iPhones, but the end reader does not need the app to see emoticons in your texts.</p>
<p>10. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-birthday-reminder">Birthday Reminder</a></strong><br />
Rarely check Facebook to see upcoming birthdays?  This app downloads all of that information so you can access and easily see upcoming bdays offline.</p>
<p>11. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/mover">Mover</a></strong><br />
Swap contacts and photos with other iPhones in an easy way.  Requires both users to have the application, but it is free and quick to download. (Similar: Bump)</p>
<p>12. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-simplify-music-2">Simplify Music 2</a></strong><br />
Listen to your entire music library from your home computer, streamed quickly and without any lag. (Similar: Simply Music, imeem)</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/4Y5PePeyqTY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4Y5PePeyqTY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>13. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-cell-minute-tracker">Cell Minute Tracker</a></strong><br />
We prefer Cell Minute Tracker to AT&amp;T’s minute tracker any day.  Much simpler, easy to navigate and much faster.</p>
<p>14. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-quickoffice">QuickOffice</a></strong><br />
Edit Word and Excel documents on the go.</p>
<p>15. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/photogene">Photogene</a></strong><br />
There are a multitude of photo editing apps out there, but you really only need one.  Crop, rotate, adjust colors, and add filters with Photogene. (Similar: Camera Bag)</p>
<p>16. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/skype">Skype</a></strong><br />
Superb quality Skype-to-Skype over WiFi using the Skype application.  Finally be free of your computer and microphone to make those long distance calls. (Similar: Truphone)</p>
<p>17. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/kindle">Kindle</a></strong><br />
Skeptical at first, but found eBook reader surprisingly easy on the eyes and good for taking in a quick chapter.  Offers plenty of free content, but won’t be replacing your physical Kindle.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RhL2SWgFx7A&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RhL2SWgFx7A&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-real-racing">18. <strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-beejiveim">Beejive IM 3.0</a></strong><br />
We mentioned this on last year’s roundup, but it deems reiteration.  So far, the best multi-IM service client on the iPhone, now with Push Notification.  AIM, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, and more.</p>
<p>19. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-redlaser">Redlaser</a></strong><br />
Extremely reluctant to include this on the list, but it does deserve a bottom slot.  Scan UPC codes for price comparisons on the go, but wait for an update for improved scanning and database.</p>
<p><strong>Best Games</strong></p>
<p>20. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-real-racing">Real Racing</a></strong><br />
Standard track based racing game, but has the best graphics on an iPhone game to-date.  Worth it alone to see what the iPhone is capable of.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/pAysP1HM6Z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pAysP1HM6Z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>21. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/sims-3">Sims 3</a></strong><br />
Slightly watered down Sims 3, but still an excellent version on the go.  Fantastic graphics and runs well.</p>
<p>22. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-my-brute">My Brute</a></strong><br />
Create a fighter and compete in daily arena matches.  Very simplistic, but highly addicting and will bring you back daily.</p>

As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.

It's a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It's probably something to do with being a geek.

Arrington's reply was both a confirmation and a warning: "<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you're fired."]]></description>

<p>As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It&#8217;s probably something to do with being a geek.</p>
<p>Arrington&#8217;s reply was both a confirmation and a warning: &#8220;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you&#8217;re fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s official: Penn and Teller - the magicians&#8217; magicians - are coming to TechCrunch 50 next month. Your response to this news will probably depend on which part of the technology barrel you inhabit. For those scraping along at the bottom - the self-described &#8217;social media consultants&#8217;, the me-too-rip-off app builders, the spammers, the search engine optimisation goons, the MySpace child groomers - it might be one of confusion. I mean, what could a couple of Las Vegas magicians possibly know about launching a technology product?</p>
<p>But for anyone else: anyone who understands that technology can actually be an art form rather than just a way to fleece gullible punters, the pairing of tech and magic makes perfect sense. I mean, Penn and Teller at TechCrunch 50 is basically the physical manifestation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Arthur C Clarke&#8217;s third law</a>: &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clarke&#8217;s law, of course, was little more than a useful crutch; a maxim that - by his own admission - he bolted on to his previous two (<em>&#8220;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right.&#8221; / &#8220;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible&#8221;</em>) because he decided three was a better number.</p>
<p>Also, by likening the kind of super-advanced technologies he wrote about to &#8216;real&#8217; magic Clarke could avoid Jules Verne&#8217;s problem of having to explain how his wonderful inventions worked, only for actual innovation to prove him wrong a few years later. Clarke&#8217;s point was that contemporary readers couldn&#8217;t possibly understand how his future technologies worked, they just did. Like magic. No further explanation required.</p>
<p>But in fact Clarke&#8217;s basic premise - that, at a certain level, the line between magic and technology becomes invisible - is absolutely right, just maybe for different reasons than he described.  Speak to any decent magician - one who has read his <a href="http://www.lybrary.com/modern-magic-p-121.html">Professor Hoffman</a> or at least his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Wilsons-Complete-Course-Magic/dp/0894716239">Mark Wilson</a> - and he will tell you about the time he saw a trick (or &#8216;effect&#8217;) that absolutely blew his mind, despite knowing every one of the technical principles behind it.</p>
<p>The one that stands out for me was the time - I was maybe 14 years old - that I watched an American magician called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williamson_(magician)">David Williamson</a> instantly restore a piece of rope that he had previously cut in half, using his fingers as a pair of scissors. The cut and restored rope is an ancient classic of magic, and there&#8217;s really only one way to do it. And yet the way Williamson employed that method was so good - so mind-blowingly, knee-shakingly good - that it (literally) made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
<p>And so it should be with technology. I remember - just as vividly as I remember David Williamson&#8217;s rope trick - the first time I bought a laptop with WiFi. For ten minutes or more I carried that laptop around my house, up and down stairs; into different rooms; even into my back yard, streaming full-screen video from the BBC website as I went. Again, I knew exactly what was going on: there was the WiFi card jutting from the PCMCIA port and I&#8217;d just spent ten minutes configuring the wireless hub. And yet&#8230; the experience of watching full-screen video on my laptop, without wires, was as near to pure magic as watching that piece of rope mend itself two feet from my eyes.</p>
<p>The comparisons between really good uses of the principles of magic and really good uses of technology are so numerous that they could fill a book. In the 1930&#8217;s, Charles Hoffman caused a sensation with a small brass tea-kettle that could - on command - pour any drink or cocktail that the audience requested. Today my iPhone, with its 3G connection and iTunes, can do the same for any piece of music ever recorded. Which one is more magical to wat<em></em>ch, really?</p>
<p>Or consider Kriss Angel who, using some invisible - but quite basic - method is able to tell a woman on Las Vegas Boulevard the precise date she was born, or what she does for a living. With Google I can summon any fact ever recorded, from wherever I happen to be in the world. Again, which is more impressive? Certainly neither is made less magical by knowing, broadly, how it works. The brilliance lies in how well the method is hidden, and how powerful the effect is.</p>
<p>And so it is with every single brilliant piece of technology, or web app that has ever been created. From the cellphone, to the iPod; from webcams to the web to WiFi. From email to eBay to Twitter to Hotmail to Shazzam to GPS to Google Maps to the Kindle. Pick your favourite, and remember how you felt when you first used it. Now remember the best magic trick you ever saw. The feeling is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Like all good rules, this one works the other way around as well. Remember the exact opposite of the best magic trick you ever saw. Your boring uncle&#8217;s card trick - the one where, through the most convoluted of methods, probably involving dividing the pack into piles and counting slowly through them - he triumphantly, and boringly, turned over the card you chose. Remember how he made you feel: you probably didn&#8217;t know what bizzare mathematics or slight of hand genius lead him to your card, but neither did you care. If he were a real magician, he&#8217;d have found the card straight away. The only person he impressed was himself.</p>
<p>The same is true of the worst technology. I don&#8217;t care how technically sophisticated <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/15/putting-wolfram-alpha-to-the-test-not-super-impressed-but-here-are-50-invites/">Wolfram Alpha</a> is, or how many genius hours it took to build it - all I know is that it forced me to think too hard, and returned results that were of no use to man nor beast. The technological equivalent of a boring uncle; the method was more impressive than the effect, and so the hairs on the back of my neck remain unstood.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Penn and Teller.</p>
<p>Of all of the magicians working today, none more perfectly illustrates the rule that a magical effect must take precedence over technical brilliance. Their stage show is a spectacular of blood and gore and guns and showgirls and pyrotechnics - and yet for their signature piece, they clear all of that aside and perform the oldest and most widely-known effect in magic: the cups and balls.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen it before, of course. Three cups, three little balls. One by one the balls vanish and, one by one, they reappear under the cups. Then, by way of a kicker, the cups are lifted to reveal three limes, one under each. But there&#8217;s more! The cups are stacked and lifted one last time to reveal - a huge lemon. Four large pieces of fruit from under three cups: cue the applause.</p>
<p>But while every magician since the ancient Egyptians has finished there, Penn and Teller announce that they are going to do the trick one more time: this time using transparent cups. It&#8217;s amazing to watch: every single load, every single sleight and steal is laid bare. You see the moment they put the limes under the cups. You even see the lemon go in. But such is the brilliance of their execution, that you&#8217;re still left both baffled and blown away. The method becomes irrelevant, the effect is everything. The audience is on their feet.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s for that reason that I&#8217;m so delighted that Penn and Teller will be at Techcrunch 50. Not for what they&#8217;re launching - although from what I&#8217;ve heard, it&#8217;s going be pretty damn cool - but rather for what their appearance will hopefully remind anyone getting ready to launch a product, either at the event or at any time in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how clever your technology - if the effect doesn&#8217;t make the hairs on the back of your audience&#8217;s neck stand up, you need to keep working until it does. But if you do manage to build something even half as impressive as that lemon appearing under that plastic cup, then fame, fortune and a well-deserved standing ovation will be yours for the taking.</p>

<p>Then, as you see from the above screenshot, we learn that Borders is talking up something <a HREF="http://www.maclife.com/article/news/borders_survey_name_drops_apple_ipad">called the iPad</a>, a noble and befitting name for a device that is a Pad and is made by Apple. I did a <a HREF="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield">trademark search</a> and came up with bupkus, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t assign it by January.</p>
<p>The Borders survey asks if you&#8217;re planning to buy an Apple IPAD (Large Screen Reading Device),&#8221; which either suggest someone at Borders is taking the piss or they have horrible web designers never talk to legal.</p>
<p>This is all well and good but of what are we certain? We know that upcoming <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/search/ipod+camera">iPods will have cameras</a> come September 8 or so and <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/search/apple+tablet">that the iPad</a> or whatever it will be called will drop in 2010. All the rest of these rumors and videos are just icing on the already delicious Apple future device cake.</p>

	<li>It's the location of the Secret Service's San Francisco field office (floors 5-6)</li>


	<li>And someone who works there has a license plate that says "Drunk"</li>

</ol>

Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to theorize how these three facts form the backbone of a massive worldwide conspiracy.  Feel free to add additional "facts," such as <em>"That building was also constructed on top of an ancient Native American burial ground"</em> or <em>"I heard that's where the Secret Service keeps all the counterfeit cash they confiscate, and the floors are really thin."</em>  Just make sure to bake in the drunk license plate, too.

<p>Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to theorize how these three facts form the backbone of a massive worldwide conspiracy.  Feel free to add additional &#8220;facts,&#8221; such as <em>&#8220;That building was also constructed on top of an ancient Native American burial ground&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;I heard that&#8217;s where the Secret Service keeps all the counterfeit cash they confiscate, and the floors are really thin.&#8221;</em>  Just make sure to bake in the drunk license plate, too.</p>
<p>I took <a href="http://techcrunch.posterous.com/risky">that picture</a> of the license plate, by the way, in the parking garage of that building. And a different picture of it ended up on the <a href="http://failblog.org/2009/07/18/license-plate-fail-5/">FailBlog last month</a>. So if you can work that into your conspiracy theory, you get bonus points.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92533" title="ref_phil_schiller2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ref_phil_schiller2.jpg" alt="ref_phil_schiller2" width="200" height="289" />As Apple&#8217;s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing, you&#8217;d have to imagine that <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Phil Schiller</a> is a pretty busy guy. He&#8217;s also been moonlighting as Apple&#8217;s keynote speaker during Steve Jobs&#8217; medical leave of absence. But now it&#8217;s really starting to look as if Schiller has taken on another task: App Store savior.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already talked at length about the two instances in the past week or so of Schiller personally <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/apples-phil-schiller-speaks-on-censored-iphone-dictionaries-but-ignores-the-bigger-issues/">reaching out to bloggers</a> to set the record straight about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/schiller-reaches-out-again-to-acknowledge-app-store-problems/">a few of the App Store issues</a>. But he has actually taken it a step farther. He&#8217;s also been reaching out to individual app makers to talk to them about their apps and offer his assistance in getting them approved, we&#8217;ve learned tonight. </p>
<p>And one such app, Rising Card, is now available in the App Store thanks to Schiller.</p>
<p>Rising Card is a magic application developed by <a href="http://theory11.com/">Theory11</a>. The reason it was initially rejected after a long period of hearing nothing from Apple was that they felt the app would be confusing to customers. Of course, that was the point of the app as it&#8217;s a magic trick meant to confuse people. The developers wrote Apple to explain that to them, but heard nothing back. They figured all hope was lost as this was hardly a high profile application, and Apple clearly didn&#8217;t seem to care too much about it.</p>
<p>Then the magic blog <a href="http://itricks.com/news/2009/08/is-apple-unreasonably-cracking-down-on-magic-apps/">iTricks picked up the story</a> which led the Apple blog <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/08/11/magic-trick-developers-find-the-trick-is-on-them/">TUAW to cover the rejection</a> a few days ago, and all of a sudden, Apple started reaching out to the developers. And of course, not just anyone at Apple, but Schiller and also Phil Shoemaker, Apple&#8217;s Director of Application Technology. Based on this and Schiller&#8217;s previous responses, it would seem that not only is Apple reading the blogs that cover App Store issues, but it really is trying to resolve them. And in this case it did. Shoemaker called yesterday to let the developers know that the app was now in the store.</p>
<p>Obviously, the developers are very pleased with situation. Jonathan Bayme, the CEO of Theory11 wrote this to us this evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>Schiller was unbelievably responsive throughout the whole ordeal. Our first communication from him was late at night on the 11th - with another email sent to us an hour later. He was extremely nice and although not promising anything, he said he would have their team look into the situation ASAP.</p>
<p>To be frank, Chris and I [the creators] were both amazed that this had reached the heights it had at all - given the fact that it is just a fun magic trick. We had spent months creating, polishing, and finishing this thing - and up until then we thought all hope was lost. It&#8217;s been quite the rollercoaster.</p>
<p>This morning, we received another email from Schiller advising us that Phil Shoemaker (Director of Application Technology) would be in touch with us soon to discuss our app, and as promised I received a phone call about three hours later from Phil. Shoemaker said that his team was looking into the issue as we spoke, and he was hopeful to see resolution of this by the end of the day.</p>
<p>True to his word - it was in fact approved late this afternoon. In sincerity the whole process was quite the ordeal, but I must say that I respect the hell out of the fact that we received the personal attention that we did. They were responsive, attentive, and truly listened to what we were saying. While one could argue that it took us over a <em>month</em> to get to that point, I would judge this situation based on the lengths they went to to fix the problem - they were incredible.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you go, another happy customer. This new Schiller strategy seems to be working wonders for the App Store.</p>
<p>But I still find it a little crazy that it&#8217;s Schiller who is personally doing this. On one hand it&#8217;s great, but it&#8217;s also odd. Perhaps that speaks to this being more serious of a situation then just some apps being rejected. After all, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC is looking into</a> Apple&#8217;s role in the App Store and how it handles app approvals/rejections. This follows Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of the Google Voice app and the removal of all apps that use Google Voice. Google and AT&amp;T are also the subjects of that investigation.</p>
<p>When the government gets involved — the government that is already looking into Apple for its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/ftc-commends-schmidt-for-stepping-down-then-steps-up-investigation/">board of director issues</a> (with Google), <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/dvd-jon-posts-his-apple-anti-trust-subpoena/">anti-competitive issues</a> (with iTunes/iPod), and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/source-apple-and-google-agreed-not-to-poach-workers/">hiring practice</a> issues (again, with Google) — you are naturally going to take things a little more seriously than you were before. The fact of the matter is that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/the-case-against-apple-is-just-as-much-a-case-for-apple/">Apple had, and still has</a>, a lot of problems with the App Store. They waited too long to fix them, and the situation started to get out of control. So it looks like Apple may have had to bring out the big guns to restore order.</p>
<p>Now, Schiller and Shoemaker cannot possibly personally look into every app, or even just every app rejection, but they appear to be focusing on the ones that are getting attention. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this was some kind of stop-gap move until the improvements to the App Store approval process that Schiller has been alluding to are ready to go. We know they&#8217;ve already broken up the iPhone PR team into <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/another-positive-sign-for-the-app-store-proof-of-a-pr-team/">two divisions now</a> (hardware and App Store), a next step could well be a complete revamping of the app approval process and team.</p>
<p>When MobileMe was having troubles following its launch last year, Steve Jobs stepped in to right the ship, and it worked. It looks like Schiller may be doing the same now with the App Store. Let&#8217;s hope that works too.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Rising Card application that led to all of this? It&#8217;s pretty good, very smartly designed. Is there any reason Apple should have rejected it? No, and so it&#8217;s good to see it in the App Store where it belongs. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=324247209&amp;mt=8">Find it here</a> for $2.99.

(Hotmail grew only 8 percent during the same period, while Yahoo Mail increased unique visitors by a healthy 16 percent).</p>
<p>If Google wants Gmail to pass Hotmail quickly and gain the No. 2 spot, my suggestion is to keep pumping in new enhancements through Gmail Labs and to speed up the pace at which mail storage increases.  Not that I am a typical user, but I am already at 97 percent of my allotted 7,358 megabytes.  One of the primary lures of Gmail has always been its seemingly endless and ever-expanding storage limits.  Please don&#8217;t make me pay for more storage.</p>

The game, which is best described as a &#8220;Guitar Hero for the iPhone&#8221;, will feature in-game song purchases, which were finally enabled with the release of the iPhone 3.0 software update in June.  If there&#8217;s a game ripe to make a killing with these in-game downloads, it&#8217;s TTR.  Tapulous expects to have the game submitted by the end of August, with general release soon thereafter depending on the App Store&#8217;s approval process.</p>
<p>So why does this matter?  Tap Tap Revenge and its various spinoffs has been some of the iPhone&#8217;s most popular games since the App Store launched last year (in fact, a very similar game was very popular on jailbroken phones before the official store even launched). Gameplay consists of tapping your fingers to a song as colorful bubbles fall down the screen, and newer versions also make use of the phone&#8217;s accelerometer so you can shake it to the beat.  As with games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, TTR tends to appeal to a very broad audience.</p>
<p>But until now it&#8217;s been handicapped by one major obstacle: there was no way for users to pay to download new songs.  On console games like Rock Band, in-game purchases have proven <i>very</i> lucrative with gamers regularly plopping down around $2 per song.   But the iPhone didn&#8217;t allow for this kind of transaction until recently, so Tapulous was forced to sell satellite games like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/04/tapulous-brings-weezer-and-world-class-djs-to-tap-tap-revenge/">TTR Weezer</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/03/tapulous-to-release-coldplay-edition-of-tap-tap-revenge-next-week/">TTR Coldplay</a>, which did well but never saw nearly the usage of the main TTR app.  Now they&#8217;ll be able to license songs from directly inside the flagship app, which means the number of paid downloads will likely skyrocket.  It will also likely be easier to get premium artists on the platform, as they will be able to sell a song or two at a time rather than entire albums.</p>
<p>As a teaser, Tapulous has sent us the following frustratingly small screenshot:</p>

Previously the service only offered users the ability to sample 30 second clips of songs, or restricted full streaming via a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/20/ilike-launches-full-song-playback-and-ad-platform/">partnership with Rhapsody</a> (now phased out).

Music is available from all four major labels and "hundreds of indie labels, enabled via MediaNet."

Rumors of the music store were <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10292389-93.html">first reported</a> by CNET's Greg Sandoval last month. Until now iLike has offered downloads from Amazon and iTunes. Those options remain.

The service is rolling out now on iLike (I was able to purchase a song), and should be available to all U.S. users by end of day, says iLike. iLike applications on iGoogle, Facebook, Bebo and other platforms will also be available "soon" says the company for U.S. users.

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re enabling the millions of music fans who discover and share music on iLike to purchase songs in-page directly from iLike.  Our solution provides a smooth, immediate in-page purchase experience. You can sign up, enter your credit card, and download the music you just bought &#8212; all without ever leaving the web page you were on when you discovered the song.</p>
<p>We’re making it easier and more immediate for music fans to buy MP3s as an online on-Web activity. iTunes already provides a great music buying experience inside a media player, and we’ll continue offering our users the option to jump off iLike to purchase from iTunes. At the same time, we’re filling a void by providing a faster way to make impulse music purchases on the web. Our social features and integration into all the major social networks will create a unique music discovery and purchasing experience for music fans across the Web.</p>
<p>The iLike in-page download solution was achieved via direct deals with major labels and a relationship with MediaNet to support the back end fulfillment and provide indie label catalogs. PayPal is providing billing support.</p>
<p>Going forward we&#8217;ll continue to enhance our download service, which is currently in Beta, as well as making it available on other leading third party websites where iLike is embedded. Our goal over time is to offer music fans the ability to impulse buy in-page from wherever they are.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other recent news about iLike, the company is rumored to be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/ilike-negotiating-a-reorganization-ticketmaster-may-be-flushed-out/">raising new capital</a> in an unusual transaction designed to push out Ticketmaster, an investor since 2006.</p>

<p>To get started, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to run the <i>man</i> command to get a list of the site&#8217;s main features.  TweetShell just launched a few hours ago so it&#8217;s buggy and is missing some common Twitter functionality, but it has most of the basics: you can login using either OAuth or the &#8216;old&#8217; less secure way, you can tweet from your account using the <i>wall</i> command, and you can browse through tweets from other users using the directory commands like <i>cd</i> and <i>ls</i>.  There are also a number of more advanced commands, though frankly I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out how some of them work (feel free to leave tips in the comments).</p>
<p>Of course, there are already a number of Twitter clients that actually run from the terminal, but this runs from the browser, which means it&#8217;s more accessible for casual use and you can access it from any computer.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.yamli.com">Habib Haddad</a> for the tip.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Here&#8217;s another nifty Twitter <a href="http://wcons.s3.amazonaws.com/c.htm">web console</a> that&#8217;s worth checking out if you like TweetShell.</p>

And that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/41bbc044/i-ve-seen-this-stupid-yahoo-site-dozens-of-times">saying about</a> a new Yahoo site, <a href="http://yahoo.knowyourmojo.com/">Know Your Mojo!</a> — and he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>The site claims to tell you what kind of &#8220;social mojo&#8221; you possess by analyzing your tweets. It&#8217;s a very simple site, below the big &#8220;What&#8217;s Your Social Mojo?&#8221; question it asks you to put in your Twitter username. You then hit the submission button and it takes you through an animation of a series of pipes. You&#8217;re spit on on the other end with what kind of Twitter user you are. The only problem? It&#8217;s different just about every time you put in your user name.</p>
<p>Of the 16 different mojo possibilities, I&#8217;ve gotten 3 different ones on 4 attempts. Scoble notes similar results. So I don&#8217;t know what kind of analyzing it&#8217;s doing, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to work too well. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t really matter because what this is really about is advertising <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/20/new-yahoo-home-page-tomorrow-heres-what-it-looks-like/">Yahoo&#8217;s new homepage</a>. It makes that pretty clear on the results page that tells you to feed your &#8220;mojo&#8221; by checking out Yahoo&#8217;s site and adding content to it.</p>
<p>While all of that has actually nothing to do with Twitter, Yahoo clearly made a Twitter analyzer to take advantage of the viral nature of the service, hoping the masses would tweet out their results and get more people to visit the site, and then Yahoo&#8217;s homepage. Sadly, it will probably work, even if the analyzer itself doesn&#8217;t.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1111-211x200.png" width="211" height="200" />There's <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=webfinger">some excitement</a> around the web today among a certain group of high profile techies. What are they so excited about? Something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a>, and the fact that Google is apparently getting serious about supporting it. So what is it?

It's an extension of something called the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">finger protocol</a>" that was used in the earlier days of the web to identify people by their email addresses. As the web expanded, the finger protocol faded out, but the idea of needing <a href="http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html">a unified way to identify yourself</a> has not. That's why you keep hearing about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and the like all the time.

But those standards, while open, have failed to latch on in a meaningful way with the public at large. One of the holdups is that you have to set up a website or service you use to be your OpenID. It's relatively easy to do, and you may already have one ready to go, but just not realize it. But it's still kind of tricky to explain to a regular web user — wait, you login with your website?]]></description>

What are they so excited about? Something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a>, and the fact that Google is apparently getting serious about supporting it. So what is it?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an extension of something called the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">finger protocol</a>&#8221; that was used in the earlier days of the web to identify people by their email addresses. As the web expanded, the finger protocol faded out, but the idea of needing <a href="http://www.abstractioneer.org/2009/04/personal-web-discovery.html">a unified way to identify yourself</a> has not. That&#8217;s why you keep hearing about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and the like all the time.</p>
<p>But those standards, while open, have failed to latch on in a meaningful way with the public at large. One of the holdups is that you have to set up a website or service you use to be your OpenID. It&#8217;s relatively easy to do, and you may already have one ready to go, but just not realize it. But it&#8217;s still kind of tricky to explain to a regular web user — wait, you login with your website?</p>
<p>But something everyone on the web knows is their email address. And they&#8217;re conditioned by services like Google and Facebook to use it as their identifier. The problem with it has been that it&#8217;s just a string of text, nothing more. You cannot attach information to it to let others know a bit more about you — something vital for true identification. Then idea behind WebFinger is that you should be able to attach any information you choose to your email address.</p>
<p>The excitement today is that a group of Googlers have apparently finally not only gotten Google&#8217;s support to pursue the project, but that they have started working the technical details. As Googler <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-fitzpatrick">Brad Fitpatrick</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/browse_thread/thread/4b367d78ef81c61d?hl=en">writes today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, we&#8217;ve eliminated both technical &amp; political hurdles.  We can now work on this spec, implement, push, try, rinse, repeat&#8230;. until we&#8217;re all reasonable happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Googler <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brett-slatkin">Brett Slatkin</a> (incidentally, Fitzpatrick&#8217;s partner in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/speeding-up-rss/">making PubSubHubbub</a>) explains to us that while it hasn&#8217;t been turned on yet, and that there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do on the spec, the idea is to go into testing mode soon. Fitzpatrick notes that there will be a small experiment going on internally with some Googlers&#8217; Gmail accounts.</p>
<p>Without knowing much about the technical details behind it, the core idea behind WebFinger immediately strikes me as a good one. It&#8217;s taking something everyone knows on the web (your email address) and making it immensely more valuable as a way to identify yourself and information about you. Exactly what kind of information? Here are some of the ideas from the WebFinger Google Code <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webfinger/browse_thread/thread/4b367d78ef81c61d?hl=en">page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>public profile data</li>
<li>pointer to identity provider (e.g. OpenID server)</li>
<li>a public key</li>
<li>other services used by that email address (e.g. Flickr, Picasa, Smugmug, Twitter, Facebook, and usernames for each)</li>
<li>a URL to an avatar</li>
<li>profile data (nickname, full name, etc)</li>
<li>whether the email address is also a JID, or explicitly declare that it&#8217;s NOT an email, and ONLY a JID, or any combination to disambiguate all the addresses that look like something@somewhere.com</li>
<li>or even a public declaration that the email address doesn&#8217;t have public metadata, but has a pointer to an endpoint that, provided authentication, will tell you some protected metadata, depending on who you authenticate as.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is definitely something to watch for in the coming months.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mj-149x200.png" width="149" height="200" />Analytics firm comScore has just released its latest statistics for video streaming sites in the United States for the month of June, and at first glance the results are quite surprising: the top video sites have seen a major shakeup, with many of the top sites abruptly falling in the rankings.

The cause, of course, is the Michael Jackson effect — media organizations around the world dedicated huge amounts of coverage to the pop star's tragic death on June 25, and many people turned to the web to learn more.  Other breaking news that month, including the Iranian election controversy, also likely contributed to the growth seen by news properties.

<a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, which has ranked as the third most popular video site in the United States for the past few months, has dropped down to seventh.  Likewise, Fox Interactive Media, which includes <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, has dropped from second to fifth.

<p>The cause, of course, is the Michael Jackson effect — media organizations around the world dedicated huge amounts of coverage to the pop star&#8217;s tragic death on June 25, and many people turned to the web to learn more.  Other breaking news that month, including the Iranian election controversy, also likely contributed to the growth seen by news properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, which has ranked as the third most popular video site in the United States for the past few months, has dropped down to seventh.  Likewise, Fox Interactive Media, which includes <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, has dropped from second to fifth.</p>
<p>So who took their place?  Video search engine <a href="http://www.blinkx.com">Blinkx</a> jumped from sixth place in May with 300,641 views to fourth overall with over 623,000 (<b>Note:</b>all figures in 000&#8217;s).  Microsoft also saw a big jump, rising from fifth place in May with 310,560 overall streams, to third place in June, with 695,661 streams (much of this gain was likely due to increased traffic to MSN and MSNBC).  Turner, the parent company of CNN, also saw its video views nearly double.</p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s Viacom, the media conglomerate that includes Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and BET.  Viacom vaulted from seventh place in May with 281,368 views to second place in June, with a whopping 773,554.  Again, much of this can likely be attributed to the Michael Jackson news that was featured prominently on MTV, but Nickelodeon also saw strong traffic, which may be related to the summer season when kids generally watch more TV.</p>

If you need proof that the stream makes complex services more accessible, take a look at <a href="http://www.glideengage.com/">Glide Engage</a>.  Launched last week, Glide Engage is a stream front-end for the <a href="http://glideos.com/">Glide</a>, a <a href=" http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/04/24/glide-an-operating-system-for-the-web/">Web OS</a> which offers a suite of integrated Web Apps including docs, <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/06/glide-crunch%E2%80%94closing-the-gap-between-online-and-offline-spreadsheets/">spreadsheets</a>, photo and music uploading and sharing, calendar, email, Website creation and collaboration tools.  Glide can be overwhelming.  There is a lot there.  But it has attracted its own loyal following of about one million registered users.  

With Glide Engage, the various features of the Glide OS become available on an as-needed basis and gives a better entry point for the service.  At first glance, Glide Engage is a micro-messaging service on steroids.  You can follow ("engage" with) other people in Glide, add comments to your stream, share links and files, create discussion groups and bring different media and people into online meeting spaces.  In the left-hand column you can also set up news alerts and see the latest articles being shared on Glide about those topics.

What makes Glide particularly interesting is that it is also a Twitter client.  You can import your Twitter stream and read it within Engage like you can with other Web-based Twitter apps.  You can Tweet out messages, but also add links to <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?edit=86">photos</a>, <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?view=88">documents</a>, playable <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?view=280">music files</a> and videos which bring people back into Glide.  Imagine if Seesmic or Tweetdeck hosted their own photos, videos, and other shared files, and had a Web productivity and communication suite as well.]]></description>

Glide can be overwhelming.  There is a lot there.  But it has attracted its own loyal following of about one million registered users.  </p>
<p>With Glide Engage, the various features of the Glide OS become available on an as-needed basis and gives a better entry point for the service.  At first glance, Glide Engage is a micro-messaging service on steroids.  You can follow (&#8221;engage&#8221; with) other people in Glide, add comments to your stream, share links and files, create discussion groups and bring different media and people into online meeting spaces.  In the left-hand column you can also set up news alerts and see the latest articles being shared on Glide about those topics.</p>
<p>What makes Glide particularly interesting is that it is also a Twitter client.  You can import your Twitter stream and read it within Engage like you can with other Web-based Twitter apps.  You can Tweet out messages, but also add links to <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?edit=86">photos</a>, <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?view=88">documents</a>, playable <a href="http://content.glidesociety.com?view=280">music files</a> and videos which bring people back into Glide.  Imagine if Seesmic or Tweetdeck hosted their own photos, videos, and other shared files, and had a Web productivity and communication suite as well.</p>
<p>The Twitter functionality is very limited at this point.  You can reply to a message or retweet it, and find some information about the person whose Twitter message you are looking at.  And when you send a Tweet, you get redirected to Twitter.  All of this is a work in progress and will improve over time.  To the extent that Glide Engage can extend its OS capabilities to Twitter, the more interesting it will become. Soon, you should be able to create Twitter groups and send out links to Glide&#8217;s collaboration spaces, which let multiple people look at photos, videos, documents, and videos in an online meeting environment.  </p>
<p>Glide also allows you to assign rights to each file you share, so a document or photo can be shared in view-only mode or you can give others editing privileges.  These privileges can be changed on a message-by-message basis.  The overall user interface could still use some simplification and isn&#8217;t as zippy as other stream reader apps (and I am not sure why the logo looks like a flaming IE logo crashing into the water), but Glide Engage also has some novel features worth exploring.</p>
<p>Glide is built on a sophisticated syncing engine, which means that it can share all of these files on mobile phones as well.  It will release an Android app for Glide Engage next week on August 18, followed by BlackBerry, and Windows.  The company will do an iPhone app at some point, but since this syncing capability competes with Apple&#8217;s MobileMe, it wants to establish Glide Engage on other mobile platforms first.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92337" title="3391612981_74a744b44a" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3391612981_74a744b44a.jpg" alt="3391612981_74a744b44a" width="267" height="400" />Movie piracy is a problem, but it&#8217;s not as huge of a problem as music piracy was this past decade. While certainly the size of the movie files and the need for fast broadband connections to get them in a reasonable amount of time plays into it somewhat, also helping is the fact that there are some fairly decent ways to get movies quickly, for a pretty fair price these days. And now Hollywood is apparently trying to change that.</p>
<p>The studios are starting to rally around a horrible new idea: Keeping new releases out of Redbox and more importantly, Netflix for 30 days. Let me repeat that: They think Netflix shouldn&#8217;t be able to ship many new movies to you until 30 days after they&#8217;re released on DVD.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&#8217;t appear to be set in stone yet for Netflix, as the studios are said to be currently negotiating this with the company, but it is <a href="http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6676736.html?nid=2705">what the studios want</a>. And the strategy is going forward with Redbox, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-redbox13-2009aug13,0,3034157.story">recently filed a lawsuit</a> against 20th Century Fox over the same issue. And now, with Universal and Warner Brothers <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-warner-bros.-throws-dvd-rental-gauntlet-down-at-redbox-and-netflix/">getting on board</a>, another lawsuit seems likely.</p>
<p>And in a move that couldn&#8217;t be less surprising, Blockbuster is on the wrong side of this. Despite the company having a strategy to do a massive roll-out of kiosks like the ones Redbox has, it is all in favor of the 30-day window, based on <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/08/blockbuster-q2-loss-lowers-2009-expectations.html">comments</a> CEO Jim Keyes made during its Q2 earnings call.</p>
<p>Why? Well the company once again completely bombed in those earnings, posting a net loss of $36.9 million, while overall sales fell 22 percent in the quarter. It is getting fleeced by the likes of Redbox and Netflix and needs to gain some sort of competitive advantage in movie rentals. A 30-day rental window for its stores would certainly offer that.</p>
<p>Of course, as the name synonymous with movie rentals for the past couple of decades, Blockbuster could have used its power to get ahead of some of these trends (by-mail rentals, cheap kiosks, online rentals/streaming), but didn&#8217;t. So now they will have to rely on the movie studios attempting to put stricter rules in place for gaining access to its movies right away. Rules, that would seem to be basically prodding users to obtain those movies illegally.</p>
<p>If the studios are allowing some places like Blockbuster stores to rent movies on day one, but limit Netflix from doing the same, how many of the millions of Netflix users are going to drive to a Blockbuster store to get that movie? Some certainly will, but a lot will also turn to the web and simply download the movie. And some who have never done that before will learn how to get around such a ridiculous restriction.</p>
<p>And Blockbuster&#8217;s comments on this are pitiful. Having failed so far with its movies-by-mail approach, online approach, and set-top box approach, Blockbuster is now turning to kiosks. It hopes to have some 2,500 of them by the end of the year and 7,000 of them by next year. Some of their ideas for them are pretty laughable (a good example is the digital transfer of movies to portable media players, but no iPod/iPhone support, meaning that basically no one would use them), but more importantly, Blockbuster is against the two things that made this solution work for Redbox: Availability and price.</p>
<p>Keyes comments during the earnings call indicate that he believe the $0.99 price that Redbox offers its movies for is far too low for a sustainable model. He probably doesn&#8217;t mean for Redbox&#8217;s end, because they seem to be <a href="http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6657094.html">doing just fine</a> — which is to say, just about the opposite of Blockbuster — using that model. Instead, he seems to be saying that Hollywood can&#8217;t survive on such a model, which again, is probably not true, but it&#8217;s good that Keyes is the movie studios new PR agent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best part of what he said though:</p>
<blockquote><p>A vending rental window would enhance the complementary relationship between Blockbuster stores and Blockbuster kiosks. On Fox, Universal, and now Warner titles, for example, we can be far more aggressive in filling the store shelves with product to assure 100% availability of hot new releases. After 30 to 45 days, we can then make use of that product in our vending channel at a substantially reduced cost of goods, since that product will be partially amortized. Our customers can then use Blockbuster stores for depth and breadth of selection and assurance of hot new releases being available on Friday night or Saturday night. The customer can use vending kiosks then for value and convenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>So basically, he wants to use the studio&#8217;s ridiculous 30-day window to prop up his own stores, which are flailing badly. He sees a movie rental ecosystem in which you get new releases from Blockbuster stores, and then slightly older options from the kiosks. Of course, both of those methods of getting movies are already dead, Keyes just doesn&#8217;t realize it yet.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s investing in these kiosks because Blockbuster has failed elsewhere to make inroads against competitors. But eventually, everyone knows that all of this distribution is going to go online, and then Blockbuster will be left with thousands of kiosks that are useless, just like its store are becoming. At least those won&#8217;t be the black holes for money that the stores are, I guess.</p>
<p>Supporting Hollywood&#8217;s ridiculous and dangerous idea to place 30-day rental holds on Netflix and Redbox, might prop up his failing brick and mortar stores a bit, but the idea that it will save them long term is laughable.</p>
<p>And Hollywood shouldn&#8217;t be tricked into thinking this 30-day rental window is a good idea because they have Blockbuster&#8217;s support. Blockbuster doesn&#8217;t matter anymore. And they well pay for that mistake in piracy.</p>

For the entrepreneur? Not so much. Hitherto unknown relatives, entrepreneurs seeking angel investments, money managers and supposed baby-mamas all come out of the woodwork with dollar signs in their eyes.</p>
<p>Since I <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/what-everyone-made-from-the-zappos-sale/">outed</a> their take-home pay from the Amazon merger a few weeks ago, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh and COO/CFO Alfred Lin have figured out a way to cope with this: Giving everyone my email address and telling them I&#8217;m in charge of their investments.</p>
<p>To be fair, Hsieh told me he was going to do this. He even told me they&#8217;d make an investment decision based on my favorite pitch. I just thought he was kidding. Then, two nights ago I had dinner with a Los Angeles-based entrepreneur who had &#8220;a hilarious&#8221; story to tell me. It seemed a friend at one of the more prominent Southern California investment firms was hounding him for an intro to Sarah Lacy. Clearly, this made no sense since writers don&#8217;t generate wealth. We&#8217;re lucky to pay rent and have some left over for booze. &#8220;No, I need to talk to her about managing this guy Alfred&#8217;s money,&#8221; the money manager insisted.</p>
<p>So let me be clear: I am not actually in charge of distributing that near-$400 million worth of Amazon stock, but if Hsieh is a man of his word, I will pass on the best single pitch I get in the next two weeks. Send to sarah(at)techcrunch(dot)com or leave in the comments.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the email he&#8217;s sending everyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you can probably imagine, since the Amazon announcement, I am being<br />
inundated with many requests for different opportunities, including<br />
private wealth management services, investment opportunities, and<br />
partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>To help sift through through the various opportunities, I&#8217;ve enlisted the<br />
services of Sarah Lacy. As a journalist and author, her career has been<br />
all about research and figuring out the story behind the story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked Sarah to help sift through many of the opportunities that I&#8217;m<br />
being approached with between now and August 31. In September, I will ask<br />
Sarah to present to me what she thinks the most interesting opportunities<br />
are for me to consider.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cc&#8217;d Sarah so you should feel free to email her directly.  However, I<br />
encourage you to reach out to her in whatever medium you think would allow<br />
you to best properly convey the value of your opportunity so that she can<br />
give it a fair evaluation relative to all of the other opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the contact information that Sarah has made publicly available on<br />
her web site:</p>
<p>http://sarahlacy.typepad.com/sarahlacy/contact.html</p>
<p>(For me personally, I&#8217;ve always found that talking to Sarah by phone or in<br />
person to be more effective and enjoyable.)</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding in participating in this process. I look</p>
<p>forward to hearing from Sarah her thoughts in September.</p></blockquote>

This time, it’s a few weeks in Brazil. Right now, I’m planning on spending the time in Sao Paolo but am open to exploring the country further if anyone knows of great start-up activity elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m working closely with <a href="http://www.endeavor.org/ ">Endeavor</a> which has done amazing work in South and Latin America for more than a decade. But as always, I want to ferret out the best entrepreneurs and investors in the country so send me an email if you have any suggestions at sarah (at) techcrunch (dot) com.

Marc Andreessen is <a href=" http://www.techmeme.com/090814/h0920">backing a new browser company</a> called <a href="http://rockmelt.com/">RockMelt</a>.  Not much is known about RockMelt other than it is being designed by an all-star team (including software engineer Robert John Churchill from the Netscape days) and that it is tied into Facebook through Facebook Connect.  Marshall Kirkpatrick at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rockmelt_netscapes_andreesen_backing_stealth_facebook_browser.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> has a screenshot of the sign-in page and speculates that RockMelt is in fact a Facebook browser.  Miguel Helft at the NYT leans in that direction as well.  It kind of makes sense since Andreesen is on the board of Facebook, but I suspect it is only half the story.

A Facebook browser, however, is a good metaphor for thinking about how browsers, in general, need to change.  What would a Facebook browser look like?  Well, to start with, you would be able to see updates from your friends on Facebook, share your own updates and media right from the browser, and perhaps IM with your friends through Facebook chat.  While those set of features would be convenient, they are nothing revolutionary.    <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>, which calls itself the social browser, already incorporates Facebook Connect (and Twitter and other social networks to boot), but it hasn't taken off.  And Facebook itself offers a <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/toolbar/">toolbar</a> for Firefox that lets you see notifications, search Facebook, and share links.  There are plenty of other <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=facebook&#38;cat=all">Firefox add-ons</a> which incorporate Facebook features as well.

But the Facebook connection may just be the starting point for a much more ambitious piece of software. ]]></description>

<p>A Facebook browser, however, is a good metaphor for thinking about how browsers, in general, need to change.  What would a Facebook browser look like?  Well, to start with, you would be able to see updates from your friends on Facebook, share your own updates and media right from the browser, and perhaps IM with your friends through Facebook chat.

There are plenty of other <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=facebook&amp;cat=all">Firefox add-ons</a> which incorporate Facebook features as well.</p>
<p>But the Facebook connection may just be the starting point for a much more ambitious piece of software.  Andreesen said as much to the NYT in an interview earlier this year, which Helft quotes from in his <a href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/technology/internet/14browser.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Andreessen suggested the new browser would be different, saying that most other browsers had not kept pace with the evolution of the Web, which had grown from an array of static Web pages into a network of complex Web sites and applications. “There are all kinds of things that you would do differently if you are building a browser from scratch,” Mr. Andreessen said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What sorts of things is he talking about?  Making the browser social appears to be at the top of the list.  The first thing you do is connect to Facebook.  But that could just be a building block for a social browser that handles Web apps in an entirely new way.  The browser was built around the Web page metaphor, but increasingly the most interesting things happening on the Web do not necessarily exist on any one Web page. They exist in real time data streams (such as Facebook&#8217;s portable News Feed and Twitter) and in richer Webtop applications.  A modern browser should be designed not only to surf the Web, but to manage your information streams and Web apps all in a seamless user interface.</p>
<p>Whether or not RockMelt is tackling this broader challenge, I don&#8217;t know.  But I hope it is because we need to move the ball forward with a radical, yet accessible, new approach.  Radical, yet accessible—that is the challenge.  It must be radical enough to open up new, more efficient, avenues of information discovery, creation, and interaction.  It must be a communications platform as well as a browsing platform.</p>
<p>The original browser model was one of consumption, of reading Web pages as if they were documents.  Despite all the progress of the past decade, we are still stuck with that legacy to a large degree because it is built into our browsers.  So what would a true social browser look like?  Below is my own wish list of features (some of these are available as add-ons or in existing desktop clients, but there is an opportunity to unify them in one seamless experience):</p>
<ul>
<li>It would have multiple modes for browsing, search, following social data stream, and launching Web applications</li>
<li>The home page would be a stream reader which brings together real time streams from across the Web (which Facebook now has with Friendfeed).</li>
<li>IM, email, and public messages (status updates and Tweets) would be always accessible in the toolbar or a sidebar</li>
<li>It would support a variety of Web apps which could be launched seamlessly within the browser without going to a Website and logging in.</li>
<li>One-button access to sharing services of your choice (Flickr, Posterous, Youtube, Wordpress)</li>
<li>Real-time search and alerts from across the Web (social stream, news, finance sites, sports sites, etc.)</li>
<li>Support for Google Gears to give the browser <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/google-gears-lets-developers-take-apps-offline/">offline</a> capabilities as well as local caching and a light database for computing tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s just off the top of my head.  If you were redesigning the browser from scratch today, what would it look like?</p>

If not, basically the URL shortening service <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">shut down</a> and said all its links would cease to work by the end of the year, dealing a severe blow to users of any URL shortening service.

<p>Perhaps you heard about 301works in one of our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/trim-cuts-off-bitlys-301works-idea-wants-to-sell/">recent pieces</a> about how Bit.ly was attempting to salvage the Tr.im wreckage. The idea was the 301works would be a centralized hub for all shortened URLs, not run by any one URL-shortener. Tr.im balked at the idea of joining, but plenty of others are, including Bit.ly, Awe.sm, Adjix, betaworks, Cligs, and URLizer. All of them are teaming up with <a href="http://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a> to launch this project.</p>
<p>One of the holdups in Tr.im&#8217;s participation was that it didn&#8217;t want one company ruling all of this data. And while Gnip will be handling it at first, to get the project off the ground, the plan is still to find a non-profit group to manage 301works. All the members are clear that they want this to be an open-source project that sets users&#8217; minds at ease about using URL-shorteners.</p>
<p>The service will launch sometime in the next few weeks, after the participating companies have a chance to tell their users that they will be backing up their links on 301works. While most are unlikely to have a problem with that, some might, so they&#8217;re giving them some time to opt-out.</p>
<p>So how will 301works actually work? Well here are the key points for how companies will be able to back up their links:</p>
<ul>
<li>URL shortening services decide the frequency that they will make updates.</li>
<li>URL shortening services decide how their updates can be made available to the public.  Some services will provide regular uploads and downloads (hourly, daily, weekly, etc) and some will opt for a pure archival approach.</li>
<li>Gnip is providing the infrastructure service to support aggregating data from URL shortening services.  Gnip will provide the infrastructure service to compress the data into pre-defined download options for end users.</li>
<li>Companies will be able to submit data via a REST API using HTTP POST over SSL. In addition, Gnip can provide other approaches on request.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this sounds great on paper, but the question of just how well this system works remains to be seen. Still, it&#8217;s promising that we&#8217;re seeing a bunch of companies take action on this so quickly after an incident that left a lot of people concerned about the future of URL-shorteners.</p>

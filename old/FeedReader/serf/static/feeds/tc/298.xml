				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/netbook-215x147.jpg" width="215" height="147" />Dell has retired their 12-inch Intel Atom-powered netbooks, they <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/blogs/direct2dell/archive/2009/08/08/dell-retires-the-mini-12.aspx">said</a> today. The official reason - <em>"It really boils down to this: for a lot of customers, 10-inch displays are the sweet spot for netbooks...Larger notebooks require a little more horsepower to be really useful."</em>

That makes absolutely no sense, since it requires no additional hardware horsepower to power a 12-inch netbook v. a 10-inch netbook. The only difference is power usage from the bigger screen. And the two extra inches more than makes up for the shorter battery life or slightly heavier device from packing in more batteries. It only costs a few more dollars to build a 12-inch v. a 10-inch netbook, and users get a bigger screen with the same performance.

In fact, Intel's official position on 10-inch netbooks is almost exactly the opposite of Dell's. Intel <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">says</a> <em>“If you’ve ever used a Netbook and used a 10-inch screen size–it’s fine for an hour. It’s not something you’re going to use day in and day out.”</em>

So why is Dell <em>really</em> discontinuing 12-inch netbooks?]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/netbook.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot2" alt="" />Dell has retired their 12-inch Intel Atom-powered netbooks, they <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/blogs/direct2dell/archive/2009/08/08/dell-retires-the-mini-12.aspx">said</a> today. The official reason - <em>&#8220;It really boils down to this: for a lot of customers, 10-inch displays are the sweet spot for netbooks&#8230;Larger notebooks require a little more horsepower to be really useful.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense, since it requires no additional hardware horsepower to power a 12-inch netbook v. a 10-inch netbook. The only difference is power usage from the bigger screen. And the two extra inches more than makes up for the shorter battery life or slightly heavier device from packing in more batteries. It only costs a few more dollars to build a 12-inch v. a 10-inch netbook, and users get a bigger screen with the same performance.</p>
<p>In fact, Intel&#8217;s official position on 10-inch netbooks is almost exactly the opposite of Dell&#8217;s. Intel <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">says</a> <em>“If you’ve ever used a Netbook and used a 10-inch screen size–it’s fine for an hour. It’s not something you’re going to use day in and day out.”</em></p>
<p>So why is Dell <em>really</em> discontinuing 12-inch netbooks?</p>
<p>Probably a couple of reasons. First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">Intel doesn&#8217;t like 12-inch netbooks</a> because they are deep into dual core territory, where Intel has much healthier profit margins. For casual users a 12-inch netbook with an Atom chip works just fine, and they are buying these devices instead of more expensive dual core machines. Intel has put pressure on OEMs to build netbooks that have 10 inch or smaller screens. </p>
<p>This includes direct pricing pressure - Intel prices Atom chips based on the size of the device screen. Anything over 10 inches is priced higher than devices with 10 inch or smaller screens. We think this is an inappropriate way to price Atom chips.</p>
<p>Dell may also be seeing customers who would otherwise buy a dual-core <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-13?c=us&#038;cs=19&#038;l=en&#038;s=dhs&#038;~ck=mn&#038;ST=dell%2013%20inspiron&#038;dgc=ST&#038;cid=36576&#038;lid=910506&#038;acd=52183,8,0,67602608,705988398,1249785662,,12057254,3333743661">13-inch</a> or <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/home/notebooks/laptop-inspiron-14/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-inspiron-14&#038;s=dhs&#038;cs=19&#038;redirect=1">14-inch</a> Inspiron choosing the lower priced (and less profitable) 12 inch netbook instead. That&#8217;s something they aren&#8217;t going to be happy about.</p>
<p>Netbooks should be getting bigger, not smaller. That&#8217;s what users want.</p>

File sharing services are not as popular today as they were four years ago. It's not that people are sharing any less. Rather, they just found easier ways to do it. Would you upload a funny video from a friend's email to any of those services or would you search for it on Youtube and share only the link? Would you upload an MP3 file in order to share with whomever, or would you search for it online, grab the link and then share it? And finally, would you use a file-sharing app just to share a picture on Facebook when you can do it directly from your desktop to your Facebook profile? Of course, you wouldn't!

So why would you use an file-sharing app anyway? Actually for many reasons: for larger files, for privacy, multiple files, file format support, and more.

In this post, I compare 16 file-sharing services.  I took three main issues under consideration when creating the comprehensive app list below: Free, Fast, and Useful . . .

<p>So why would you use an file-sharing app anyway? Actually for many reasons: for larger files, for privacy, multiple files, file format support, and more.</p>
<p>In this post, I compare 16 file-sharing services.  I took three main issues under consideration when creating the comprehensive app list below: Free, Fast, and Useful . . .</p>
<p>Most of the services suggested require no registration. None of them will ask you to download anything to your computer, and all of them are easy to use, and worth using. It is actually great to see services, such as <a title="Yousendit" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/04/i-finally-got-you-send-it-to-work/" target="_blank">Yousendit</a>, <a title="MailBigFile" href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/" target="_blank">MailBigFile</a>, and <a title="Rapidshare" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/ouch-german-court-slams-rapidshare-with-34-million-fine/" target="_blank">Rapidshare</a>, that are still relevant and are good choices, but if I had to pick one it would be <a title="Mediafire" href="http://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank">Mediafire</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get confused now.  This is not a list of services that let you store all your files in the cloud, organizes them, or allows you to collaborate with friends. It&#8217;s more focused on file-sharing only, in the richest capacity—well, okay, you be the judge of that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90746" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tcscreen1.gif" alt="tcscreen1" width="630" height="634" /></p>
<p><a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net/" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-90751 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11.gif" alt="11" width="100" height="56" /></a> <a href="http://box.net">Box.net</a> is probably the most commonly-known site featured here. But I couldn&#8217;t keep it from the list because it&#8217;s really a good one and despite all its features, it&#8217;s actually simple to use. The light version is not so attractive though. Here&#8217;s what you get: File uploads up to 25MB/file (OK, that&#8217;s pretty lame). 5 collaboration folders, 1GB storage, mobile access, public file sharing, folder widget, and a few more options. The other plans are far richer, but for personal use, the free one is enough (except for the lame file uploads limit). One thing that bothered me is that you can&#8217;t upload a file without signing up. That&#8217;s the old fashion way, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rapidshare.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-90754 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/15.gif" alt="15" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a href="http://www.rapidshare.com/">Rapidshare</a> is lacking in features &amp; design, but if you&#8217;re looking for a one-click file host, you came to the right place. Founded in 2006, the service is the twelfth most visited homepage in the world. With Rapidshare, users can upload big files (200MB) in one step and subsequently make them available to friends and family via the download link. Premium accounts offer additional convenience, through TrafficShare that provides the option to make files available for direct downloading. The recipient of the file can access it instantaneously even if he/she is not a premium account member of RapidShare. A file can be downloaded 10 times, and will be deleted after 90 days.</p>
<p><a href="http://drop.io/"><img class="size-full wp-image-90757 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2.gif" alt="2" width="100" height="48" /></a> I always liked <a title="drop.io" href="http://drop.io/" target="_blank">drop.io</a> and even now with much more usage than before, it is still simple to  understand. No need to sign up in order to quickly send a private link with your file(s). Maximum file upload is 100MB, but there are three different packages that will give you a whole lot more. Back to the free service; you can share, collaborate, and present music, videos, documents, audio, in a private drop, through email, web, phone, fax, and more. Additionally, you&#8217;ll be able to privately chat with the people you share a file with, in real-time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.filedropper.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90760" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2009-08-07_175843.gif" alt="2009-08-07_175843" width="100" height="50" /></a> <a href="http://www.filedropper.com/">Filedropper</a> aims to give the most basic file hosting service that enables you to share stuff quickly. Therefore, there&#8217;s nothing complicated here, just upload the file, and share it. Simple as that. Filedropper says you can upload up to 5GB per file, which looks a bit odd to me - after all, who needs that (unless you are transferring HD videos, I guess)? Very similar to Filedropper, is <a title="FileSavr" href="http://www.filesavr.com/" target="_blank">FileSavr</a>, which offers you the same package completely, with a slight change: uploads up to 10GB per file&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://wikisend.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90762" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/4.gif" alt="4" width="99" height="38" /></a> I actually marked this one as a favorite: <a href="http://wikisend.com/">Wikisend</a> - an elegant and simple interface that helps you share files quickly. Share files with your friends using email, social networks, your blog, forums and so on. You can also protect the file with a password and choose the range of the file&#8217;s lifetime up to 90 days (max)</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.driveway.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90764" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/6.gif" alt="6" width="99" height="33" /></a> You can use <a title="Driveway" href="http://www.driveway.com/" target="_blank">Driveway</a> even without registration and send up to 500MB </span>max for each upload.  S<span>igning up for a free account offers several advantages: </span><span>A registered user can upload up to 2 GB of data to the Driveway account. </span><span>Additionally, you can upload, manage and create widgets for files and folders and search for files/folders within your account. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.send6.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90765" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/7.gif" alt="7" width="100" height="41" /></a> With the free plan of <a title="Send6" href="http://www.send6.com/" target="_blank">Send6</a>, you can send files up to 100MB size, which you can store in your 250MB free space. Send6 also has a free plug-in for Outlook that allows you to send large files directly from your Desktop. Please note that you don&#8217;t need to register to send files to friends. Sharing is done via email only.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zshare.net/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90768" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/8.gif" alt="8" width="99" height="39" /></a> <a href="http://www.zshare.net/">Zshare</a> is mainly used to share files that are too big to be sent via e-mail. With Zshare you can host files, images, videos, audio and flash in the same place, and as long as they remain active they can be downloaded limitlessly. Zshare lets you upload files up to 1GB, and if you register for the service (still free), you&#8217;ll be able to share them privately. Premium members get faster downloads (like most of the services here) and the ability to upload up to 2GB per each upload. Multiple files are allowed in both free and premium lines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.2large2email.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90769" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/10.gif" alt="10" width="100" height="27" /></a> Overall, <a title="2large2email" href="http://www.2large2email.com/" target="_blank">2large2email</a> has a nice and comfortable email-like interface for sharing large files. How large? 100MB in the free plan. However, if you&#8217;re looking for something good and free, 2larg2email is not your answer. The service won&#8217;t give you any additional features but password protection, and your files can be downloaded up to 7 times, will be saved for only 7 days, and will expire after that. For more features, you&#8217;ll have to pay, or move and chose another service. BTW, I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t pay for premium services, but if there are other services for personal use, that offer you more for less, you may want to check them out first.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.senduit.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90771" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/12.gif" alt="12" width="100" height="44" /></a> For busy people, <a title="Senduit" href="http://www.senduit.com/" target="_blank">Senduit</a> is the best choice there is! It&#8217;s a one-page platform that generates a private link from the file you upload (100MB Max) for easy sharing. You can send the link via email through Senduit&#8217;s page directly, or copy-paste the link to any other communication channel (IM, Social networks, etc.). You get to choose when the link will expire—from 30 min. to 1 week.</p>
<p><a href="http://new.flyupload.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90775" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/13.gif" alt="13" width="99" height="43" /></a>I couldn&#8217;t find the exact amount that you can upload per file to <a title="Flyupload" href="http://new.flyupload.com/" target="_blank">Flyupload</a>, but the service looks great. Flyupload allows you to store, access, share and backup your digital documents, photographs, and music easily with complete privacy online. Registered users get extra features like 2GB space of files, Multi-uploads with an upload progress bar. You can also upload large files via FTP or create folders and keep track of files and Images. Additionally, Flyupload lets you share files from your database, to your Twitter account with a side tool called: Flyontwit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90776" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/14.gif" alt="14" width="100" height="27" /></a>If I had to choose one service only from this list, <a title="Mediafire" href="http://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank">Mediafire</a> would be it. The service has a good looking UI, with some great usability. It lets you share files even when you&#8217;re not logged in and gives you a set of tools to complete this experience. For individual use, you can freely share files up to 100MB with unlimited uploads, unlimited downloads, unlimited bandwidth, and unlimited storage. This is why you might choose Mediafire over 2large2email, for example. When signing up, Mediafire enables you to organize your files in folders, search and view your files, and email/share/embed with others. It&#8217;s the best service that you can get for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.divshare.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90777" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/17.gif" alt="17" width="100" height="45" /></a>I was surprised to see that underneath the new layout of <a title="DivShare" href="http://www.divshare.com/" target="_blank">DivShare</a> is the same <a title="great service" href="../2007/10/12/divshare-upgrades-its-one-stop-shop-free-file-hosting-service/" target="_blank">great service</a> from three years ago. And, even more surprised to discover some files I had stored 3 years ago in the service are still there! DivShare is a file management service that not only lets you share files, but also saves them for later (for an unlimited period of time). The maximum size per file is 200MB and you have 5GB space for free to start. After the upload, you&#8217;ll be able to embed your videos, audio and slide shows on any web site or profile. Diveshare has an <a title="iPhone" href="http://www.divshare.com/iphone" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and Facebook applications, a Wordpress plug-in and an open API, if you want to build something yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90779" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/19.gif" alt="19" width="100" height="40" /></a>Back when I tried <a title="MailBigFile" href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/" target="_blank">MailBigFile</a> in 2005, I thought this was a great service that offered a convenient solution to sending larger files. I still think it&#8217;s a good service. You don&#8217;t need to sign up, but if you choose to this is the best pro account for your dollar. Even though, you can use the service for free and as long as you want to send up to 200MB per file via email (but with no additional features). MailBigFile has the best price for a pro account - <a title="$15/year" href="http://www.mailbigfile.com/pricing/" target="_blank">$15/year</a> with an impressive list of features.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yousendit.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90780" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/18.gif" alt="18" width="100" height="58" /></a>Last but not least is good old <a title="Yousendit" href="http://www.yousendit.com/" target="_blank">Yousendit</a>, which has never plummeted in its presence online. A reliable and secure service since 2004 that offers the ability to send free 100MB files with a maximum number of 100 downloads allowed per file. You use it just like an email, choose a recipient, send it directly to a person&#8217;s inbox, and you get a notification when your file is downloaded.</p>
<p>Sharing files, large or small, should be a simple act, in my opinion—not something that should require a major effort or thought process on your behalf or make you create a complicated profile/account to use it. The options I listed here will help you explore the diverse file-sharing opportunities currently available. Whether you need to send a file privately or publicly, small or big, temporary or permanent, the options are all in this list, you just need to find the best match for your needs.</p>

It provides results from Google, Yahoo and Bing in three columns but doesn't tell you which column is which search engine. You then tell it which one you think shows the best results, and you then see which answers are from which engines. I keep choosing Yahoo as the best results.

A few search engine experts we've spoken with over the years say that users tend to think Google results are better just because they're from Google. If you take any search engine and put the logo on top, it tests better. So Yahoo results with a Google logo will always test better than, say, Google results with the Yahoo or Bing logo. People are just used to thinking about Google as the best search.

This search tool strips out all the branding, so you're forced to really think about which results you like better.

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-29-109x200.png" width="109" height="200" />New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had planned to take the entire day tomorrow to use Twitter to send out mundane updates about his life. Unfortunately, the Hudson River <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/08/hudson.helicopter.crash/index.html">accident</a> today has forced him to <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F51974CE-219B-8B95-7C1E25F612F86FBE&#38;utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_campaign=social">reschedule</a> his Twitter plans, so he can, you know, actually do his job.

So those who were hoping to know what Bloomberg was eating for lunch, what he's thinking about while walking his dogs, and updates about the Yankees game, will have to wait. Why was Bloomberg planning to tweet for the day? Well, because he's running for re-election and undoubtedly heard about the power of social media in campaigns these days.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90822" title="picture-29" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-29.png" alt="picture-29" width="143" height="262" />New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had planned to take the entire day tomorrow to use Twitter to send out mundane updates about his life. Unfortunately, the Hudson River <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/08/hudson.helicopter.crash/index.html">accident</a> today has forced him to <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F51974CE-219B-8B95-7C1E25F612F86FBE&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social">reschedule</a> his Twitter plans, so he can, you know, actually do his job.</p>
<p>So those who were hoping to know what Bloomberg was eating for lunch, what he&#8217;s thinking about while walking his dogs, and updates about the Yankees game, will have to wait. Why was Bloomberg planning to tweet for the day? Well, because he&#8217;s running for re-election and undoubtedly heard about the power of social media in campaigns these days.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s kind of sad is Bloomberg&#8217;s actual <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg">Twitter stream</a>. While it&#8217;s pretty clear that it&#8217;s not actually run by him right now (hence, the idea of him tweeting for the day actually being compelling), his tweet stream is filled with shameless self-promotion to follow him, and touting his day of tweeting. He #followfriday&#8217;d himself no less than <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg/status/3183835567">two</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg/status/3182662999">times</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Anyone looking at his tweet stream for information about the Hudson River accident? You&#8217;re out of luck. That might actually be useful.</p>
<p>Still, it was definitely a good call by the mayor to pass up the Twitter promotional stunt to deal with the tragedy.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pinocchio-205x200.gif" width="205" height="200" />As anyone who has read my critically acclaimed, Pulitzer-Prize-winning <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/book">book</a> will know, I have not always been the paragon of honesty I am today.

Truth be told, in the past I have been guilty of prevarication on an Olympian scale in almost all aspects of my life. In business, in relationships, in friendships and even - during one epically drunken evening in a London pub a couple of years ago - in all three at the same time, leading to hilarious consequences, no small amount of heartache and the beginning of my journey of self-improvement. It's a long story. You should <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/book">buy it</a>.

Given my past indiscretions, then, it's both perfectly fitting and deliciously ironic how much I hate being lied to. Or rather, how much I hate discovering that I've been lied to. I really can't put into words how furious it makes me; with the liar, the lie and with myself for believing them both. I could probably forgive you for cheating on my sister (I don't have a sister) or running over my cat (I don't have a cat), providing you're honest with me about it. But the moment you lie, and I find out about it, we're done.

So you can imagine how I felt this week when I found out I'd been lied to multiple times by not one but two separate people, regarding two different stories I was trying to report. I won't name names on this occasion, for reasons I'll get to, but the details are important.]]></description>

I could probably forgive you for cheating on my sister (I don&#8217;t have a sister) or running over my cat (I don&#8217;t have a cat), providing you&#8217;re honest with me about it. But the moment you lie, and I find out about it, we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>So you can imagine how I felt this week when I found out I&#8217;d been lied to multiple times by not one but two separate people, regarding two different stories I was trying to report. I won&#8217;t name names on this occasion, for reasons I&#8217;ll get to, but the details are important.</p>
<p>The first liar presented himself to me on Monday when Lacy and I were working on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/spotify-and-the-great-leaps-of-faith/">a story</a> about European music house-of-cards Spotify. Ordinarily I am more than able to resist the temptation of doing actual journalism, but a source very close to the company had reached out to me with details of their latest fundraising round and so I felt I had something uncharacteristically useful to contribute to Sarah&#8217;s solid reporting of the story. The source was willing to tell me all that he knew on the proviso that I wouldn&#8217;t quote him directly or identify him in any way. With every reason to trust him - or rather no reason not to - I agreed.</p>
<p>(Journalism students will have correctly determined that he was asking for a neat subset of &#8220;off the record&#8221; sourcing called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>. Well done journalism students, go to the top of your irrelevant class.)</p>
<p>A few hours later, as is good practise when dealing with unattributable information, I spoke to another well-placed source  for verification. &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve heard from my source,&#8221; I said, before spelling out what my Deep Throat had told me. The second source listened intently but with a look of increasing confusion spreading across her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did you get this stuff from __________, by any chance&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to talk about sources,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She laughed, for an uncomfortably long time. &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ve obviously been talking to __________. He does this all the time - exaggerates or out-and-out lies to reporters off the record, knowing he won&#8217;t be quoted. He thinks he&#8217;s some Machiavellian character but the truth is he&#8217;s just not very good at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>No. He most certainly is not.</p>
<p>Moving right along, and if you follow me on Twitter you can probably guess the identity of my second liar of the week. You might even have read the open letter I wrote to him on my blog, but let&#8217;s keep his name off TechCrunch just this once. Sufficed to say he&#8217;s someone with whom I&#8217;ve had numerous conversations - some on the record, others off - in which he&#8217;s told me his side of what is a very weird and very painful story of lies, betrayal and start-ups-gone-bad. In return I&#8217;d given him a fair hearing and, I thought, reported the facts in a way that was fair to all parties.</p>
<p>But as time went on, his version of events began to unravel. More and more independent information that I received pointed to the fact that I&#8217;d been mislead - and on a few comical occasions the liar&#8217;s new lies even began to contradict his previous ones.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously. Being fooled by one off the record liar in a week is unfortunate, two starts to look like carelessness. You can imagine how angry I felt.</p>
<p>And yet with that anger came a sudden realisation: with almost every lie I&#8217;ve ever been told professionally, the circumstances have been the same. The person telling it has always insisted on being off the record, ostensibly because the information they&#8217;re giving me is so sensitive that they would risk losing their livelihood if they were revealed as the source. But really because they are talking out of their ass with a serious agenda and don&#8217;t want to be exposed as a liar. It&#8217;s happened to me maybe fifty times, and I&#8217;m not even a real reporter.</p>
<p>What seems to have been forgotten in the past few years, by both sources and reporters, is that an off the record agreement is not a one-way deal which allows an interested party to spin a story without any risk that it will come back and bite them on the ass. Rather it&#8217;s a contract between two parties, designed to ensure that the truth can be told, in keeping with the public interest, without fear of oppression.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a way for a source to feel safe in revealing, honestly, what they know, in return for agreement that the reporter would go to jail before identifying him or her. The reporter is agreeing to take all the heat for the story; to put their ass on the line for the source - and the price of having the reporter take that risk is total honesty. Think <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100655.html">Mark Felt </a>and Bob Woodward; that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work.</p>
<p>And yet, until now, the big difference between the &#8220;off the record&#8221; contract and any other binding contract is that the former didn&#8217;t carry any penalties whatsoever for breach. Even if all  evidence points to an anonymous source being 100% full of shit, the fact remains that the reporter has agreed in advance not to identify them. Sure, I&#8217;ll never trust either of my two liars again, but they&#8217;re still free to scamper off to another reporter and peddle the same bullshit with a decent chance it&#8217;ll be published, at least as a rumour.</p>
<p>Every technology and business reporter I&#8217;ve spoken to this week about the <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1596">off the record problem</a> has their own story to tell about bullshitting sources, and every single one says they don&#8217;t know what to do about it. They just consider it one of the risks of the game.</p>
<p>Well enough&#8217;s enough. The one-sided contract ends here.</p>
<p>From now on, if you tell me something off the record and I later discover that you&#8217;ve knowingly mislead me, our contract of anonymity is immediately void, for breach. That means that everything you&#8217;ve told me about the story becomes on the record, and fully attributable.</p>
<p>Every.</p>
<p>Single.</p>
<p>Thing.</p>
<p>I will call you out on your lies and I will embarrass the hell out of you, to the point that no reporter - or any other right-thinking human being - will ever believe a word you say ever again. If there&#8217;s any justice in the world, you&#8217;ll also be fired. And have your sister cheated on, and your cat run over.</p>
<p>This new policy starts today, and over the coming days and weeks I&#8217;ll be taking my message on the road, selling the idea to every other reporter I meet. It&#8217;s time those of us who write about business and technology begin holding ourselves to the same standards we expect from any other kind of reporting,  and it&#8217;s time to indict those backroom bullshitters who think that journalists are their own private press machines.</p>
<p>Consider yourself warned, liars. Your free ride stops here. Because God knows, if there&#8217;s one person more unwise to bullshit than a bullshitter, it&#8217;s a reformed bullshitter.</p>
<p>And, yes, you can absolutely quote me on that.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/7943solidsnakestitunesv.png" alt="7943solidsnakestitunesv" title="7943solidsnakestitunesv" width="256" height="256" class="alignright size-full wp-image-90740" />This is completely a rumor, but an awesome one. Citing a &#8220;pretty reliable&#8221; source, <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/08/08/apple-itunes-9-details-blu-ray-app-organization/">Boy Genius Report is saying</a> that the next version of iTunes will add a bunch of new, highly requested features. Specificially, BGR&#8217;s source says iTunes 9 features Blu-ray support, a new way to organize iPhone apps within iTunes, as well some kind of integration with Twitter, Facebook and possibly Last.fm.</p>
<p>Each of those features have been talked about for some time now on the web. But as BGR notes, the talk of Blu-ray does line itself up well with an <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/07/apples_next_imacs_rumored_with_compelling_new_features.html">AppleInsider report</a> from yesterday that very vaguely suggested Apple has new iMacs due shortly with features that have long been on the wish-lists of Mac owners. Blu-ray is certainly on that list, and seems like a pretty good candidate, despite Steve Jobs&#8217; calling the format a &#8220;bag of hurt&#8221; as recently as October of last year.</p>
<p>More compelling may be the talk of a new way to organize iPhone/iPod touch apps in iTunes. This has been badly needed ever since it became clear that people were downloading a ton of apps to use on one device. Currently, system for managing them within iTunes is quite franktly, awful. The concept video posted at the bottom of this story shows how it really should work.</p>
<p>BGR says the Twitter/Facebook/Last.fm stuff from its tip was more vague, but you can imagine that if such features were integrated it would involve tweeting out or updating your Facebook status with what song you are listening to. It&#8217;s possible that for Last.fm, iTunes would build-in support for logging what songs you are playing, something which Last.fm currently does through its own software.</p>
<p>The Twitter angle is also interesting because of the rumors of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/twitter-mania-google-got-shut-down-apple-rumors-heat-up/">talks between the two companies</a> a few months ago. We were unable to confirm those rumors, but perhaps the two sides did meet to talk about something like this. Obviously, that&#8217;s just speculation.</p>
<p>Apple has worked with Facebook in the past to get support for uploading pictures built-in to the newest version of iPhoto. The integration is pretty slick as it also allows you to tag Facebook friends in pictures, and keeps edits made on both iPhoto and Facebook in sync.</p>
<p>And just imagine if Apple made a feature not only to send the name of a currently playing song to Twitter and Facebook, but if it included a link to buy the song on iTunes as well. That could mean some significant sales.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re speculating, I would also love to see a Genius feature for iPhone apps, something which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/13/the-app-store-needs-a-genius-feature-asap/">I talked about the need for</a> recently.</p>
<p>Again, these are all just rumors for now, but we could see if they&#8217;re true or not as early as next month when it&#8217;s likely that Apple will hold some kind of iPod even, just like it does every September.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90729" title="2354794964_e5625b1c9d" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2354794964_e5625b1c9d.jpg" alt="2354794964_e5625b1c9d" width="300" height="199" />It has now been over a month since we first <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/push-gmail-comes-to-the-iphone-—-through-an-app-if-its-accepted/">wrote about GPush</a>, an iPhone app that uses Apple&#8217;s Push Notification system to alert you when you have new Gmail messages. Like so many other apps, it was starting to look like Apple simply may not accept it. But a surprise came to developers last night: An email from Apple accepting the app.</p>
<p>Now, before you get all excited, it&#8217;s not live just yet. The developers had an issue with the Amazon servers they use to run their system, so they temporarily took the app down, but the team expects things to be back to normal and the app to be in the store in the next 24 hours, we&#8217;re told. Again, as far as Apple is concerned, the app is good to go.</p>
<p>If you need to know about the app itself, I suggest you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/push-gmail-comes-to-the-iphone-—-through-an-app-if-its-accepted/">read our initial piece</a>, but it&#8217;s pretty straightforward, it brings push support to Gmail on the iPhone via Push Notifications because Apple doesn&#8217;t support push Gmail natively, for whatever reason. What we&#8217;re more interested in is the timing of this acceptance.</p>
<p>Granted, this is all speculative, but the timing of Apple accepting a Gmail push notification app that it has been sitting on for a month is curious. Earlier this week, Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">stepped down</a> from Apple&#8217;s board of directors. A few days prior to that, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC sent letters</a> to both Apple and Google inquiring about the their relationship as it relates to the App Store. This was brought about by Apple <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejecting</a> Google&#8217;s Google Voice app. And then yesterday, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/source-apple-and-google-agreed-not-to-poach-workers/">we reported</a> that Google and Apple did have a no-poaching rule for hiring between the two companies, something which the Justice Department was looking into.</p>
<p>Could all that pressure, specifically on Apple as it relates to Google, have caused Apple to accept this app? Or, at the very least, did Schmidt&#8217;s removal from Apple&#8217;s board pave the way for this? The developers are wondering the same things. Sure, it may sound silly that Apple&#8217;s stance on one app could be changed by these things, but we do know that Apple has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/apples-phil-schiller-speaks-on-censored-iphone-dictionaries-but-ignores-the-bigger-issues/">started watching</a> even single app rejections/non-approvals more closely as no less than Apple VP Phil Schiller is now <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">weighing in</a> on them.</p>
<p>Or maybe this is the first sign of a thaw for Apple&#8217;s frigid policies with developers who create apps in what it considers to be a gray area. I&#8217;m not saying GPush was definitely one of those apps (though we did wonder that from day one), but a month is a long time to wait for approval, even by the App Store&#8217;s standards. And the GPush developers say that they did not change anything in the app to make Apple accept it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the acceptance, if you&#8217;re a Gmail addict, it will be a good thing to have GPush in the store. As I said, look for the app sometime in the next 24 hours in the App Store. It will be $0.99 for the first week of availability, then the price will go up to $1.99.</p>

<p>Ever since the new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/firefox-35-hits-five-million-downloads-in-24-hours-respectable-but-not-a-record/">Firefox 3.5 came out</a> about a month ago, I&#8217;ve been using it as my main browser. Generally I am very happy with it. Pages load a lot faster than they did before, the plus-sign feature in tabs which launches a new one is a godsend, and I am very excited about the prospects for all of the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/demo-firefox-35-treats-videos-like-web-pages-why-cant-flash-do-that/">open video technologies</a> built into it.  But there is one persistent bug that might push me to another browser: it keeps crashing on me.</p>
<p>This usually happens when I have too many tabs open (like 15 or 20, which is not unusual for me towards the end of the day).  The whole thing will just freeze and I&#8217;ll have to force the browser to quit.  When I relaunch I get a message like the one above, sheepishly saying, &#8220;Well, this is embarrassing.&#8221;  Yes, it is embarrassing. A modern browser should be able to handle dozens of open tabs, and if there is a problem with one, it should be able to isolate it and allow you to carry with your business in the other tabs.</p>
<p>Without basic stability, none of the other great features or add-ons really matter much. Mozilla needs to fix this issue fast because Firefox 3.5 is already gaining a lot of traction.  Net Applications has it at a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/report-firefox-35-jumps-to-45-market-share-in-a-month-ie-hemorrhaging-slows/">4.5 percent market</a> share at the end of July, while <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-daily-20080701-20090808">StatCounter has it at 9.4 percent</a> as of today.  People are using this as their main browser, despite the beta label, and there are plenty of other powerful choices out there from Safari to Chrome to, yes, even IE8.</p>
<p>I realize that Firefox 3.5 <del datetime="2009-08-08T17:34:25+00:00">is a</del> just came out of beta, and to be fair, it has become slightly more stable over the past month (it was crashing every day in the beginning, now it is just every few days).  I&#8217;ve been patiently waiting for the crashing to stop as Mozilla releases patches and updates. And I&#8217;m on a developer build, so maybe I&#8217;m just asking for crashes.  But plenty of other <a href=" http://search.twitter.com/search?q=firefox+3.5+crash">people are complaining</a> as well.  Is Firefox 3.5 crashing for you?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/iphoneshot2-97x200.png" width="97" height="200" />As one of the most popular applications on Apple's popular iPhone platform, a lot of users are eagerly awaiting the next version of the app. And that wait is almost over.

"<em>The app is pretty much done - we're just working on translating it into a bunch of languages</em>," Facebook developer <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/3188129643">wrote</a> tonight on Twitter.

That means that shortly, we'll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook's site, the ability to "like" items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">video support</a> for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly. And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.]]></description>

<p>&#8220;<em>The app is pretty much done - we&#8217;re just working on translating it into a bunch of languages</em>,&#8221; Facebook developer <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/3188129643">wrote</a> tonight on Twitter.</p>
<p>That means that shortly, we&#8217;ll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook&#8217;s site, the ability to &#8220;like&#8221; items and a new customizable home screen.

And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t get too worked up just yet. We asked Hewitt if &#8220;pretty much done&#8221; meant next week perhaps. His response: &#8220;<em>Can&#8217;t be sure - translating could take a while.  I&#8217;ve been avoiding predicting an actual release date</em>&#8220;. And of course even when the app is done, Facebook still has to submit it for approval in the App Store, and as we all know, that can be a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">crapshoot</a>. We could see it next week, we could see it 6 months from now. Though, Apple does seem to do a pretty good job pushing important apps like this one through quickly. Funny how that works, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Facebook is also finally working on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/pigs-fly-as-facebook-and-google-work-together-on-an-android-app/">an Android app</a>. That should drop any day now.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90699" title="2436608184_56fb589b10" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2436608184_56fb589b10.jpg" alt="2436608184_56fb589b10" width="320" height="180" />While Google CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> was on Apple&#8217;s board of directors, the two companies had an agreement not to hire away each other&#8217;s workers, a former Google employee with knowledge of such matters has told us. We have since confirmed this with other ex-Googlers. This was not a written agreement, and was considered non-official, but it was well-known and followed within the recruitment division of Google, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>This news follows a report <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/02/AR2009060203412.html">by The Washington Post</a> in early June that the Justice Department was looking into this very issue. That report cited sources close to the investigation stating that the government was looking for possible antitrust violations among several tech companies, including Google and Apple, with regard to their hiring policies. But that report didn&#8217;t say whether or not it was actually taking place. According to our sources, it is.</p>
<p>Or at least, it was. Another interesting element to this is that the main component of this understood agreement between the two companies was Schmidt&#8217;s position with each, one source tells us. Now that Schmidt has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">stepped down</a> from Apple&#8217;s board of directors, that agreement may be off, they went on to say. It&#8217;s hard to know that for sure until actual hiring starts taking place, but one source says that both Google and Apple have been ramping up their staffing departments recently, presumably to make a bunch of hires.</p>
<p>To be clear, this unwritten agreement was that Google would not go after Apple employees, and vice versa. However, employees of both companies were free to apply to the other company on their own, we&#8217;re told. That&#8217;s a small, but important difference as the practice of going after other company&#8217;s talent, also known as &#8220;poaching&#8221;, is considered to be an important component of healthy competition in the market. That&#8217;s why the Justice Department is looking into it.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90702" title="jobsschmidt" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/jobsschmidt.png" alt="jobsschmidt" width="331" height="249" />While plenty of tech companies have non-compete clauses that would seem to make poaching moot, both Apple and Google are headquartered in California, which is known for not recognizing non-compete portions of contracts.</p>
<p>This news comes amid much controversy between the two companies. The stated reason for Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">stepping down</a> was the growing overlap the two companies have on the product side. But the FTC was (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/ftc-commends-schmidt-for-stepping-down-then-steps-up-investigation/">and still is</a>) also looking into the overlap between Google and Apple on its board of directors. And more recently the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an inquiry</a> into the relationship between Google and Apple (and AT&amp;T) on Apple&#8217;s App Store. That followed Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of Google&#8217;s Google Voice app.</p>
<p>And it goes even deeper. A few months ago, there was <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/02/09/apple-asked-google-not-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-and-google-complied/">a report</a> (written by me, for another publication) that the reason Google didn&#8217;t put multi-touch support into its Android mobile operating system was because Apple asked it not to. More recently, Google admitted that it scrapped plans for a Latitude native iPhone app in favor of a web app because, yes, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/why-is-google-latitude-a-web-app-and-not-a-native-app-because-apple-said-so/">Apple asked it to</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both Google and Apple for comment on this latest matter, but have yet to hear back from either. We will update if we do.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We&#8217;ve just received an email from a source that would seem to very directly confirm the agreement between Apple and Google in print. We&#8217;ve removed the names, a few details that could identify our source, and exact date, but the email was sent in the summer of last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>From: XXXXX XXXXX &lt;XXXXX@google.com&gt;<br />
Date: XXXXXXX XX, 2008 X:XX:XX AM PDT<br />
Subject: Re: Google Opportunities- Follow up email&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.  I don&#8217;t believe that we have been in<br />
contact previously - apologies if I am wrong about this.</p>
<p>From your reference to the [APPLE DIVISION], I take it that you are<br />
currently working there.  If this is the case, we will not be able to<br />
proceed with your application.  Google has an agreement with Apple<br />
that we will not cold call their staff.  If you are not currently<br />
working at Apple and are interested in learning more about [A GOOGLE DIVISION]<br />
please let me know and I would be happy to chat with you.</p>
<p>Thank you again for returning my email.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Google has an agreement with Apple that we will not cold call their staff.&#8221; That would seem to once again confirm that Google was not allowed to poach Apple staff, but implies that they could have talked if it was the Apple employee who initially reached out (which wasn&#8217;t the case here).</p>

Since June, the site has lost over 48% of its global traffic, falling from a peak of 58.3 million monthly visitors to 30.1 million less than two months later.  These aren&#8217;t fuzzy stats, either— Scribd is <a href="http://www.quantcast.com">Quantcast</a> Quantified, which means the traffic is directly measured (you can see their full stats <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/scribd.com#traffic">here</a>).</p>
<p>We reached out to Scribd CEO Trip Adler, who says that the site is currently toning down its SEO efforts and further reducing pirated content.  He also writes that there&#8217;s a dip associated with the summer season:</p>
<blockquote><p>We made some changes that will have a short-term impact on traffic.  Primarily: 1) improving our copyright filter, which keeps unauthorized content off the site and 2) reducing the aggressiveness of our SEO, which reduces total traffic in the near term but increases the relevancy of Scribd links in search engine results 3) trending down typical in the summer time &#8212; we experienced this last year at this time and other major sites (YouTube , Google Books ) are experiencing the same.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not concerned about the dip - we expect traffic to go back up quickly.  The metrics we care about at Scribd are active members of our community and uploads of unique, authorized works.  As long as these numbers keep growing, we are positioned very well for long-term growth in unique visitors.</p>
<p>These product changes are part of a long-term strategy to focus on user experience and quality content.  We call it a &#8220;controlled growth strategy&#8221;, similar to what Facebook did a few years ago.  We have a lot product changes planned in the next few months that will increase quality / relevance / stickiness of the site.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like Scribd has some major changes coming, and it&#8217;s understandable that the site might want to prepare for those in advance.  Still, it isn&#8217;t often that you hear about a site <i>voluntarily</i> killing nearly 50% of its traffic — perhaps Scribd didn&#8217;t expect its changes to have such a major effect (it&#8217;s sort of hard to believe that they aren&#8217;t concerned about the dip).  That said, Scribd is still ranked as the 130th most visited site on the web by Quantcast, which is hardly anything to scoff at.</p>

<p>A new music service called <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> has attracted millions of users in a short time with the enticing lure of listening to any common song on your computer free. Meanwhile, the digital music grandpa Napster has quietly launched a $5 service that offers unlimited streaming plus free MP3 files.</p>
<p>A closer examination reveals that Spotify has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/confirmed-spotify-now-valued-at-e170-million/">raised</a> tens of millions of dollars, given equity to the record labels, is under constant attack by hackers, uses clever P2P technology, is accruing enormous per song royalty obligations and has the seemingly impossible task of figuring out how to generate enough money from a free ad model to satisfy the music companies.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my admittedly biased look at both companies:</p>
<p><big><strong>Spotify:</strong></big></p>
<p>Spotify is a music service to browse and play songs from a library of 3.5 million songs. Users can create custom playlists, culling out their favorite songs and the service generally gets high marks for an intuitive user interface and peppy performance. It is a free ad supported service in which users get banner ads and audio ads. There&#8217;s also a $13/month premium level which gives you an advertising free experience. The service is available in U.K., Sweden, Norway, Finland, France and Spain and the premium service is available in other EU territories. U.S. access is not available although company representatives are saying it is coming.</p>
<p><em>Technology:</em></p>
<p>Unlike other web based services like imeem and Last.fm, Spotify requires a downloadable client available for Mac or Win computers. When songs are requested they are delivered from either the Spotify central servers or other users computers using P2P (peer to peer). This means Spotify will use your bandwidth even when you&#8217;re not listening music to service their other customers. They have filed a patent for this technology. Music is delivered using the Ogg Vorbis q5 codec at around 160Kbps which sounds nice and is also speedy to load.<br />
<em><br />
Background:</em></p>
<p>Spotify was founded in 2006 by serial entrepreneurs Daniel Ek (previous CTO at Stardoll, founder of Advertigo and Evertigo among others) and Martin Lorentzon (one of two co-founders of Tradedoubler, the largest European online affiliate advertising company). Spotify is based in Luxembourg to avoid taxes although most of its employees are in Sweden, the UK and Romania.</p>
<p><em>Finances:</em></p>
<p>While Spotify has been tight lipped about financing amounts and sources <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/confirmed-spotify-now-valued-at-e170-million/" target="_blank">details</a> have leaked out and they reveal that Spotify has raised millions from its wealthy founders and tens of millions from venture capitalists. Similar to imeem, Myspace Music and Lala, the major labels own part of Spotify.</p>

<p><em>Security:</em></p>
<p>Since Spotify has 3.5 million songs it is an obvious target for hackers. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.steike.com/code/spotify-vs-ollydbg/" target="_blank">battle</a> pitting Spotify programmers against net hackers trying to decipher how the technology works. Code within the Windows version attempts to block debuggers so the Mac version is a more easy target. Several software programs have been released which download tracks from Spotify such as <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=spotsave" target="_blank">spotifysave</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=despotify" target="_blank">despotify</a>. Spotify has is available in a limited number of countries, but its been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/03/how-to-try-spotify-immediately-no-matter-where-you-live/">well documented</a> that the only check is on the initial signup page and its trivial to bypass. Users can easily bypass this by going to <a href="http://www.defilter.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.defilter.co.uk/</a> and entering the signup URL: <a href="https://www.spotify.com/en/get-started/" target="_blank">https://www.spotify.com/en/get-started/</a> A UK mailing code like W1T 3EF  is required but users simply look those up at<a href="http://www.postcodesearch.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.postcodesearch.org.uk/</a></p>
<p><em>Economics:</em></p>
<p>The Spotify CEO boasted they have spent just £5,000 ($10,000) in total marketing the Spotify service in the UK and attracted 1 million users doing 10 million streams making it the cheapest and most effective service launch since Google. Missing from the calculation is the royalty obligation. Like all webcasters, Spotify must pay a per song fee for every song they play. These range from 1 cent per play (for interactive playback) to 0.2 cents (radio experience). While the rates seem modest they add up quickly. 10 million streams per day translates to $100,000 per day, $30mm/month and $360 million annually in royalties - just for the UK operation. Royalty rates are similar in other countries and its Spotify claims 1mm users from Sweden as well. Advertising from audio and banner ads cannot generate even a sizable fraction of these royalty obligation.</p>
<p>Spotify is a on quest to get paid monthly subscribers and has launched a $13/month service. They join a crowded field of competitors including Napster who recently relaunched their subscription service moving from $12.95 down to $5/month. The Napster service includes unlimited streaming like Spotify but also 5 free MP3s to add to your permanent collection each month.</p>
<p><big><strong>Napster:</strong></big></p>
<p>Literally weeks before the economic meltdown Napster <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/15/best-buy-puzzles-with-napster-acquisition/">was sold to</a> electronics retailing giant Best Buy. Best Buy&#8217;s plan is to cost effectively market the Napster service to their large customer base. To achieve this, Napster had to move away from their limited Microsoft orphaned DRM service to a MP3 service. This would allow the service to work with all devices sold by the big box retailer. Recently, they announced a $5/month service where you can stream any song - much like Spotify - but you also get 5 free MP3s per month to add to your personal collection. Since most newer MP3s are $1.29 this is a cost savings in itself and the unlimited free streaming is a bonus. Users paying for an annual service can immediately download 60 tracks plus a bonus 10 making the cost of tracks 85 cents.</p>
<p>Like AmazonMP3 and itunes, Napster has a rich uncle to lean on to not only promote their service, but add other business segments to rationalize a low or no-margin digital music business. Apple sells ipods, Amazon sells other stuff while you&#8217;re shopping for MP3s and Best Buy can send you home with electronic gear they profit from selling. Using this financial flexibility Napster is able to offer an industry leading price point for a full streaming and MP3 service. This renders other services seem overly expensive and uncompetitive.</p>

<p>Future</p>
<p>Users have largely rejected paying a monthly fee for music subscriptions. The masses have ignored subscription services like Napster and Rhapsody which offer similar catalogs, some music portability and limited device support. Cheaper radio services like early paid Pandora have also been failures (although a desperate Pandora is bringing it back to try again). There&#8217;s little reason to believe that customers are willing to pay $13/month to stream music mostly to their PC. (Even Pandora estimates only 3% will pay a monthly fee.) This leaves Spotify with strictly an advertising-based business. Ad rates cannot generate revenues sufficient to pay even the mandated royalty rates much less all the costs of running a high tech business. Publicly Spotify is promising a US launch and mobile clients (iphone and<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ALGPknOsiU" target="_blank">Android</a>) however this completely ignores the incongruity of the underlying economics. Current royalty rates are too expensive by 10-100x for an advertising business to work. This is why Youtube dropped music videos in the UK. Getting more users will not improve the upside-down economics.</p>
<p>Napster&#8217;s new service has lowered the bar dramatically to a modest $5/month for unlimited streaming and personal MP3 collecting. It&#8217;s not clear that Napster can generate a profit from this service, but as a tiny division of Best Buy it&#8217;s not clear they are required to. What is clear is the $5 price point means financial pressure on standalone digital music companies. The music selling and radio business is increasingly being commoditized. Profits are being squeezed to the point of unsustainability. This spells pending doom for imeem, Pandora, Myspace Music, Slacker and the newest entrant Spotify unless there is an industry-upheaving royalty rate change.</p>

Co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/biz-stone">Biz Stone</a> has <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/adventure-continues.html">posted a new update</a> on the situation on Twitter's blog today. Apparently, the attacks are still ongoing, and while Stone refuses to speculate on the motivation behind them, he does note that they appear to be "geopolitical" in their nature.

Says Stone:
<blockquote>The ongoing, massively coordinated attacks on Twitter this week appear to have been geopolitical in motivation. However, we don't feel it's appropriate to engage in speculative discussion about these motivations.

Co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/biz-stone">Biz Stone</a> has <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/adventure-continues.html">posted a new update</a> on the situation on Twitter&#8217;s blog today. Apparently, the attacks are still ongoing, and while Stone refuses to speculate on the motivation behind them, he does note that they appear to be &#8220;geopolitical&#8221; in their nature.</p>
<p>Says Stone:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ongoing, massively coordinated attacks on Twitter this week appear to have been geopolitical in motivation. However, we don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s appropriate to engage in speculative discussion about these motivations. The open exchange of information can have a positive impact globally and our job is to keep Twitter services running reliably to the best of our ability.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is in line with various <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090806/p86#a090806p86">reports</a> around the web suggesting that a group of Russian hackers are targeting Georgian users, and possibly <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10305200-245.html">just one user</a>. Similar attacks also <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/ddos-attacks-crush-twitter-hobble-facebook/">targeted Facebook</a>, LiveJournal, Blogger and YouTube. While certainly this would fall into the realm of cyber terrorism, what&#8217;s crazy is how this is echoing elements of actual terrorism as well. We&#8217;ve gotten multiple tips from parties either claiming or denying responsibility for the attacks, much like terrorist factions claim or deny responsibility when a bomb goes off somewhere.</p>
<p>Sadly, given the success the responsible parties have seen in taking down these sites, it seems likely that it will only embolden others to carry out more attacks of this nature in the future. Twitter notes that it is doing all it can to prevent that and to resolve this situation, but as Stone writes, &#8220;<em>Denial of Service attacks are a known quantity on the web and they are not going away any time soon.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter has been posting updates on its status blog to let users and third party developers know what is going on. On top of taking out Twitter&#8217;s main service, these attacks forced it to shut down many of its API services, which obviously crippled many of the services built on top of Twitter&#8217;s platform. Twitter is <a href="http://status.twitter.com/post/157979213/restoring-api-and-sms">still working</a> on restoring those. The API team is <a href="http://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/3181201031">encouraging</a> developers to post questions on their mailing list <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/">found here</a>.</p>
<p>One recent <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/11c2f6890f61a5a0">update</a> in that list is pretty telling for how serious these attacks are:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know all too well Twitter, among other services, has been getting hit pretty hard with a DDoS attack over the past 24+ hours. Yesterday we saw the attack come in a number of waves and from a number of different vectors increasing in intensity along the way. We were able to stabilize our own service for a bit, hence <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/update-on-todays-dos-attacks.html">Biz&#8217;s post</a> saying all was well, but that didn&#8217;t mean the attacks had ceased. In fact, at around 3am PST today the attacks intensified to almost 10x of what it was yesterday. In order for us to defend from the attack we have had to put a number of services in place and we know that some of you have gotten caught in the crossfire. Please know we are as frustrated as you are and wish there was more we could have communicated along the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key point there is obviously that the attacks intensified almost tenfold from what they were seeing yesterday. That&#8217;s not good.</p>

<p>Assetize currently has support for parked accounts at Blogger/Blogspot, Friendfeed, Gmail, Google Groups, Google Voice, Ning, Twitter, Wordpress,  and Yahoo!.</p>
<p>While there is nothing in Twitter&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">terms of service</a> that explicitly states you cannot squat on names, you can be sure it won&#8217;t like the idea of using these accounts as placeholders with ads. Also, Twitter&#8217;s TOS is full of talk about copyrights and how it can &#8220;reclaim&#8221; Twitter names if there is some kind of dispute over the name.</p>
<p>So park at your own risk.</p>

<p>That means the company has roughly doubled in valuation from a year ago, when investors bought stock at a €100 million post money valuation. And the service hasn&#8217;t yet left beta.</p>

When Amazon paid <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/">$928 million for Zappos</a> in July, it got a little something extra in the box: the <a href="http://www.clothes.com/">Clothes.com</a> domain.

<p>When Amazon paid <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/">$928 million for Zappos</a> in July, it got a little something extra in the box: the <a href="http://www.clothes.com/">Clothes.com</a> domain.  It turns out that Zappos bought the domain last year from Idealab for $4.9 million (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-gross-2">Bill Gross</a> strikes again). </p>
<p>The detail is tucked away in <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312509155961/ds4.htm">Amazon&#8217;s SEC filing </a>about its acquisition of Zappos:</p>
<blockquote><p>In May 2008, we acquired the Clothes.com internet domain name from Idealab. The domain name was recognized as a purchased intangible asset with a useful life of 20 years. The entire purchase price of $4.9 million was assigned to the price of the domain name intangible asset and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over its remaining estimated useful life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;we&#8221; in that sentence is Zappos (now Amazon).  At $4.9 million, the Clothes.com sale would have been the second largest reported <a href="ttp://www.dnjournal.com/archive/domainsales/2008/ytd-sales-chart-2008.htm">domain-name transaction in 2008</a> after Fund.com ($10 million), and the second biggest one <a href="http://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm">so far this year</a> after Toys.com (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/27/toysrus-buys-toyscom-at-auction-for-51-million/">$5.1 million</a>).</p>
<p>The Clothes.com URL goes to a Zappos landing page with a clothing product smackdown.  Zappos is primarily known as an online shoe retailer, but sells clothing as well.  Such a large investment, however, suggests that Zappos may have had plans to branch out more aggressively into clothing, perhaps under the Clothes.com domain.</p>
<p>(Thanks to reader <a href="http://www.leap.com/">George Kirikos</a> for the tip). </p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spacelocker-logo.png" class="shot2" />I had never heard of <a href="http://www.spacelocker.com">Spacelocker</a> before, have you? <a href="http://www.spacelocker.com/howzitWork.php">Apparently</a>, it&#8217;s a social network where you can go to &#8220;meet friends and connect to online stuff&#8221; but <em>not</em> to upload and store photos, videos, or music. So essentially it&#8217;s like Facebook or MySpace but without the goodies. Or Twitter, but then offering an &#8220;evocative experience that is fun, free and functional&#8221;. I have absolutely no idea what that means either, and I won&#8217;t find out either because I never actually signed up.</p>
<p>We got an e-mail from Son Lee yesterday, who wanted to alert us to the misleading registration process Spacelocker boasts and particularly the way the company handled her complaint about it. After reading through the communication and taking a peek at Spacelocker, we&#8217;ll gladly oblige.</p>
<p>What happened was Lee registered for the service using her Gmail account, and Spacelocker didn&#8217;t waste any time sending all of her contacts an e-mail with an invitation to try it out too without her explicit consent or knowledge. These sorts of things regretfully happen all the time, but there&#8217;s more to the story.</p>
<p>When Lee complained to the company about the whole situation, she not only simply got her account wiped out, but she also received this jaw-dropping, unprofessional response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Son,</p>
<p>You obviously can write English. However I think you have a problem reading English; or are careless when you read. The sign up page has 2 forms on it. One form is to be used by those who want spacelocker to automatically invite their friends. The other form is to be used if you do not want to invite your friends. There are big red letters on the left side form that tells you to read the note on the sign up page before you sign up. The note on the sign up page tells you about the sign up procedures. There is a link to a blog on the sign up page which further explains the sign up procedures in detail. The terms of service and privacy policy of Spacelocker clearly set out what you have agreed to by signing up. You obviously failed to read any of that before you signed up and now you want to blame us for your carelessness!!! Incredible!!!</p>
<p>Her is a link to the sign up: http://www.spacelocker.com/signUp.php Read it and think if you can!</p>
<p>Spacelocker Ltd<br />
www.spacelocker.com<br />
the happiest space on earth</p></blockquote>
<p>The rudest space on earth, more like it. </p>
<p>Technically, sure, the company has a point. There are in fact two separate forms one can use to register for the service, and only one has the annoying habit of spamming the hell out of your relatives, friends and colleagues. The problem is that it&#8217;s <a href="http://nospinpr.com/2009/06/09/spacelocker-the-social-media-train-wreck/">very misleading</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=2f3ef94e4b93948b&#038;hl=en">obviously designed to confuse users</a> as much as possible while steering clear of doing anything illegal. Just take a look at the <a href="http://www.spacelocker.com/signUp.php">sign-up page</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spacelocker.png" /></p>
<p>The registration form on the left reads &#8220;use your aol, gmail, hotmail or yahoo account&#8221; while the form on the right lets your register with a different e-mail address. But if you don&#8217;t want to spam all your contacts, the latter would actually be the form you&#8217;d need to use, even if you use a webmail account. Despite the fact that it reads &#8220;don&#8217;t have webmail? sign up here!&#8221;. How&#8217;s that for misleading?</p>
<p>Oh, and does the company effectively say they&#8217;ll be sending out an invitation to all your mail contacts when you sign up using the form on the left? Sure it does. See that microscopic line at the very bottom of the screenshot above? There&#8217;s that clear policy of theirs right there!</p>
<p>My guess is the red line that reads &#8216;please read the note below before signing up&#8217; was added only after complaints started trickling in, but to me it&#8217;s clear that Spacelocker is purposely trying to trick new users so they can get some extra e-mail addresses to spam. And to add insult to injury, they feel the need to behave so rudely when a user files a formal complaint. </p>
<p>Classy, Spacelocker, very classy. I think I&#8217;ll go look for an evocative experience that&#8217;s fun, free and functional elsewhere.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/nbs.png" class="shot2" />Going over the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/techstars-incubator-hatches-10-new-companies/">10 startups</a> that were profiled by guest author <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/don-dodge">Don Dodge</a> yesterday on the occasion of their TechStars 2009 &#8216;graduation&#8217;, <a href="http://nextbigsound.com/">Next Big Sound</a> to me seemed one of the more interesting ones and I wanted to take a closer look at it. Basically, it&#8217;s a statistics and comparison engine à la Alexa or Compete, but for music artists and industry professionals. </p>
<p>And while I think that&#8217;s inherently a good idea, there are a couple of flaws in the system that put a downer on the experience. I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>What Next Big Sounds aims to be is a place where you can go to see how fans interact with music online, virtually in real time. Look up a music artist, say <a href="http://www.nextbigsound.com/artist/19998#plays,month">Manu Chao</a>, and you&#8217;ll get a nice overview of how many &#8216;plays&#8217; his music is getting on his MySpace, Last.fm and iLike profile, measured by week, month or all time. Wanna see how many fans your favorite artist has on any of those sites or other services such as Facebook and Twitter, how many times one of his accounts was viewed and how many comments it gets? No problem, click the corresponding tab and you&#8217;ll see a nice graph representing the evolution of all these elements. </p>
<p>Also a neat feature is that you can subscribe to any given artist in the NBS database and get fed RSS items or e-mailed alerts with updates on all that is measured. Furthermore, much like Alexa and Compete for website traffic, you can do comparisons between artists and bands, enabling you to track their online evolution in comparison with others.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/nbs-manu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/nbs-beatles.png" /></p>
<p>A couple of gripes. When you sign up for the service, you can opt to register as a fan, an &#8216;industry professional&#8217; or an artist but nowhere does NBS specify what the difference is. I signed up as a fan and set out to get some basic statistics on bands that I like, and quickly noticed that Next Big Sound&#8217;s database is currently too far from complete to be truly useful. </p>
<p>I did a search for a band I like called &#8220;Blackbox Revelation&#8221;, which yielded zero results, and trying my luck with electro dance sensation &#8220;Justice&#8221; there were multiple options yet the service failed to tell me which would be the right one to pick. YouTube isn&#8217;t tracked at all, and neither are services like Rhapsody and Pandora. Finally, it would be cool if Next Big Sounds let you check the online activity centered around individual tracks or albums instead of merely the artist&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it&#8217;s a great idea and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing it evolve in the future, but for now it&#8217;s clear that the service requires some extra work and polish.</p>

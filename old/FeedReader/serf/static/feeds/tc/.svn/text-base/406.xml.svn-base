				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pt-155x199.jpg" width="155" height="199" />We guard the final 50 new products and startups that launch at <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com">TechCrunch50</a> closely, and don't let anyone know the final list until the day of the event (not even press gets the list). But we also generally pre-announce one of the presenting companies to give the audience a taste of what's to come. 

And this year, I'm very proud to announce that <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com">Penn &#038; Teller</a> will be launching a new consumer tech product at TechCrunch50.

The duo has worked together for 30 years, and in September they'll be celebrating their fifth year as headliners in their own theater at the Rio All-suite Hotel &#038; Casino, as well as two Emmy nominations for one of my favorite shows, their Showtime series “<a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do">Penn &#038; Teller: Bullshit!</a>” (I even embedded a clip of their show in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/26/we-put-pepsis-ridiculous-new-aquafina-product-to-the-test/">this post about bottled water</a>).

Plus, Penn Jillette will be on stage showing their new product for the first time to the 2,000 or so people who will be at TechCrunch50. And I think you're going to love it.

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-66-215x160.png" width="215" height="160" />In its developer Google Group, Twitter has just made the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/1e07e332ec3d449d?pli=1">announcement</a> that it is releasing an early preview of a brand new API: The retweeting API. And that's not all, Twitter is in the process of completely revamping its retweet functionality.

From the looks of it, this could mean some pretty big changes on Twitter. As you can see in the mock-ups above and below, the retweet (written as "RT" in most tweets) is no longer a part of the actual tweet itself, but rather is a link below the tweet. While that certainly is a cleaner way of doing things, it will be interesting to see if this makes retweeting less or more enticing. And it could potentially help users find new people to follow (more on that below).

But as co-founder Biz Stone notes on the Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/project-retweet-phase-one.html">blog</a>, the current method of retweeting on twitter.com is a cumbersome process of copying and pasting. They want to change that. He calls this "Phase One" of "Project Retweet," and notes that it is going out to developers first so they can be ready for the change, and indicates that it's not quite ready for prime-time:]]></description>

In its developer Google Group, Twitter has just made the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/1e07e332ec3d449d?pli=1">announcement</a> that it is releasing an early preview of a brand new API: The retweeting API. And that&#8217;s not all, Twitter is in the process of completely revamping its retweet functionality.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this could mean some pretty big changes on Twitter. As you can see in the mock-ups above and below, the retweet (written as &#8220;RT&#8221; in most tweets) is no longer a part of the actual tweet itself, but rather is a link below the tweet. While that certainly is a cleaner way of doing things, it will be interesting to see if this makes retweeting less or more enticing. And it could potentially help users find new people to follow (more on that below).</p>
<p>But as co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/biz-stone">Biz Stone</a> notes on the Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/project-retweet-phase-one.html">blog</a>, the current method of retweeting on twitter.com is a cumbersome process of copying and pasting. They want to change that. He calls this &#8220;Phase One&#8221; of &#8220;Project Retweet,&#8221; and notes that it is going out to developers first so they can be ready for the change, and indicates that it&#8217;s not quite ready for prime-time:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are still sketching out exactly how this feature and its API counterpart works. Sharing our thoughts before launching means developers will have the opportunity to prepare their applications. In a few weeks or so we&#8217;ll launch the feature on our web site and because app developers had a chance to prepare, it should become available across most of the Twitter ecosystem about the same time. This way, we can all enjoy retweeting—however we choose to access Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92111" title="retweet" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/retweet.png" alt="retweet" width="320" height="240" />And the ramifications of this are potentially even larger. With the new method, all of your friends will see the original tweet you&#8217;re retweeting in their timeline (unless they have this option turned off). So if I&#8217;m not following <a href="http://twitter.com/ev">@ev</a> (Twitter co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/evan-williams">Evan Williams</a>) in the example that Stone drew to the right, I will still see his tweet in my stream because Stone retweeted it. This seems like a great idea for new follower discovery.</p>
<p>Stone notes that the new retweet look will launch to a limited group of users first for a set period of time so the team can test how it will work on the system. It will then get a wider roll-out in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Writes Twitter developer Marcel Molina in the Twitter developer Google Group about the new API:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retweeting has become one of the cultural conventions of the Twitter experience. It&#8217;s yet another example of Twitter&#8217;s users discovering innovative ways to use the service. We dig it. So soon it&#8217;s going to become a natively supported feature on twitter.com. It&#8217;s looking like we&#8217;re only weeks away from being ready to launch it on our end. We wanted to show the community of platform developers the API we&#8217;ve cooked up for retweeting so those who want to support it in their applications would have enough time to have it ready by launch day. We were planning on exposing a way for developers to create a retweet, recognize retweets in your timeline and display them distinctively amongst other tweets. We&#8217;ve also got APIs for several retweet timelines: retweets you&#8217;ve created, retweets the users you&#8217;re following have created, and your tweets that have been retweeted by others.</p></blockquote>

<p>And today brings more people backing that up. <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2009/08/13/sources-confirm-no-apple-tablet-at-sept-event-coming-in-2010/">Sources tell The Loop</a> that the tablet will definitely <em>not</em> be a part of the September event (which is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/">focus on music and the iPod</a>, just like all other Apple September events do). Jim Dalrymple writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very reliable sources familiar with the product have said speculation of the tablet being introduced during the September event are flat out wrong. The Apple tablet, they said, would not see the light of day until the first part of 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>In linking to Dalrymple&#8217;s piece, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/13/insider-eh">Daring Fireball says</a> basically the same thing, &#8220;<em>I’m almost certain there’s no tablet coming this year. It’s a 2010 thing,</em>&#8221; writes John Gruber, who also has a very good track record on these types of things.</p>
<p>The point is that while all indications are that a tablet (or <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/large-form-ipod-touch-to-launch-in-fall-09/">large-form iPod touch</a>) is coming from Apple, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/report-the-large-form-ipod-touch-apples-tablet-on-track-for-early-2010/">2010 seems like</a> a much more likely launch window. Apple has spent the past couple of years doing smaller, more focused events centered around specific product categories. A September event with an Apple Tablet would simply overwhelm the other announcements they plant to make there, like the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/happy-hour-cocktail-is-all-about-the-benjamins/">&#8220;Cocktail&#8221; project</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">iTunes 9</a> and entirely <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/prepare-yourself-for-ipod-video/">new</a> iPod touches.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;d bet on Apple doing another special event in the first quarter of 2010, focused around this new device and maybe previewing the iPhone 4.0 SDK which this thing may have something to do with (just a guess there). Remember, Apple isn&#8217;t doing Macworld this year, so it doesn&#8217;t necessarily even have to be in January, but rather they&#8217;ll wait until they&#8217;ve perfected it. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/videos-probably-fake-apple-tablet-in-action-but-awesome/">Whatever <em>it</em> is</a>.</p>

<p>There are ads, and the there are ADS. <a href="http://dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> now features the latter, in what I can only describe as the most in-your-face advertisement I have ever seen on the web. About the only thing that could catch your eye more is if its next ad is for a porn or dead kittens.</p>
<p>Very clearly, the washing detergent Cheer is now sponsoring Dictionary.com&#8217;s homepage, but I&#8217;ve never seen a site with an ad so big that I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s actually a service being offered at all. <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a> features huge pictures on its site too, but they&#8217;re tasteful images that provide a nice backdrop, this is just God-awful. And worse, the entire thing is clickable, to take you to Cheer&#8217;s page.</p>
<p>This make the huge ads that MySpace and IMDb run (shown below), look tasteful. And it almost makes me forgive ESPN.com for its <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/01/05/i-will-not-be-visiting-espncom-ever-again/">greedy advertising practices</a> — almost. And yes, it&#8217;s kind of like Pandora, but you listen to Pandora, you don&#8217;t have to look at it. </p>
<p>I know times are tough, and everyone including us needs to sell ads to make the business work, but come on. At what point do you stop being a service and start being a billboard?</p>
<p>Luckily, if you are actually able to find the text input box to look up a word, the resulting page doesn&#8217;t feature the same ad backdrop. Unfortunately to do this initial search, you have to visit the page. Which I probably won&#8217;t be doing anymore.</p>

August is a horrible time for tech. There's not much out there right now, just a few headsets and some early back-to-school stuff. The retail refresh hasn't hit - that comes in about October - and the Interwebs are quiet. It's great to have a little bit of frisson in our lives, something to put on our Christmas lists. 

With that we present today's Tapplet rumors. First, we have rumor of a <a HREf="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090813/here-it-comes-but-what-is-it-exactly-apple-plans-keynote-event-for-september/">September 8event</a> at Apple HQ for music devices. This is Apple's traditional time for releasing new music gear. It's just before back-to-school and it gives them a little time to get stuff into the retail space by October, just when kids are starting to break the iPods they got last year. So what could it be? Could it be a new iPod? iPods with cameras? Or it might be...

Well, they've succeeded in the first part, but the second? That could be much more difficult.

Microsoft's new device sounds great: OLED screen, HD radio, HD video (720p) outputs, powerful Tegra chip, and most importantly a iPod-beating price of $219.99 for the 16 GB variety, and just $289.99 for the 32 GB version. That latter is a $110 savings over the comparable iPod touch, which the Zune HD clearly targets. And now it has a very real release date: About a month from now, September 15.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090813/p19#a090813p19"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92015" title="platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg.jpg" alt="platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg" width="360" height="206" />A lot of people</a> today are excited about the new Zune HD. And that&#8217;s great news for Microsoft, as it has been attempting for a few years now to even just steal some buzz from Apple in the MP3 market, if not sales. Well, they&#8217;ve succeeded in the first part, but the second? That could be much more difficult.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s new device sounds great: OLED screen, HD radio, HD video (720p) outputs, powerful Tegra chip, and most importantly a iPod-beating price of $219.99 for the 16 GB variety, and just $289.99 for the 32 GB version. That latter is a $110 savings over the comparable iPod touch, which the Zune HD clearly targets. And now it has a very real release date: About a month from now, September 15.</p>
<p>Are the planets aligning for a hit version of the Zune, finally? Not so fast.</p>
<p>Apple typically takes the first week of September to hold a press event to show off its new iPods. Last year, the event was on Tuesday, September 9. This year, that same second Tuesday is on September 8. Music industry sources <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090813/here-it-comes-but-what-is-it-exactly-apple-plans-keynote-event-for-september/">tell MediaMemo&#8217;s Peter Kafka</a> that Apple is going to hold an event the week of September 7. Bingo.</p>
<p>So yes, it looks very likely that Apple will hold its next iPod press event one week before the launch of the new Zune. And what does that likely mean? Aside from Apple likely talking about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/happy-hour-cocktail-is-all-about-the-benjamins/">the &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; music format</a> project it has been working on, and quite possibly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">a new social iTunes 9</a>, also very likely to drop are the new iPod touches. Yes, the device the Zune HD is competing against. Uh oh.</p>
<p>Why uh oh? Well because while the Zune HD looks good compared to the current iPod touch, the new versions will certain be seeing some upgrades. What are the two most likely upgrades? <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/prepare-yourself-for-ipod-video/">A camera</a>, which the Zune HD doesn&#8217;t have. And a price drop. Again, uh oh.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/13/zune-hd-ipod-touch">Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber has</a> some inside information here or if he&#8217;s just making a prediction, but what he writes today certainly sounds like it could be the case for the new iPod touches:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Zune HD prices look good compared to today’s iPod Touches, but not so much compared to the new camera-equipped ones Apple is set to announce next month (16/32/64 GB for $199/299/399).</p></blockquote>
<p>That would make the Zune HD 32 GB only $10 cheaper than the comprable iPod touch. And again, with no camera, and no apps (at least not yet anyway). The Zune HD could still very well hold an edge with an OLED screen (it&#8217;s not clear if a new iPod touch would feature that) and the HD-outputs, but would that really be enough to dethrone the dominant player in the market?</p>
<p>Look, the Zune HD does sound very nice, and I&#8217;ve said as <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/04/a-zune-with-100-less-suck.html">much</a> <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/05/zuuuunnnneeehd.html">many</a> times. But the overall idea of the Zune is still <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/07/the-turning-of-microsofts-massive-cargo-vessel.html">a bit odd to me</a>. It&#8217;s Microsoft burning money to compete in a market (MP3 players) that is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/the-ipod-as-we-know-it-is-dying/">slowly fading away</a>. Now, there is undoubtedly a plan to get apps on it eventually, and I&#8217;m sure games, to turn it into more than an MP3 player. But right now, there is basically no mention of any of that by Microsoft. So that means that when it does happen, it will likely be months from now.</p>
<p>And even with those, the bigger question remains: What&#8217;s the end game here for Microsoft, which makes its money off of Windows and Office?. </p>
<p>My point is that Microsoft has spent the entire lifespan of the Zune chasing Apple&#8217;s tail, for what? The first hard drive-based Zunes came years after the iPod, and didn&#8217;t sell well. Then it released a Flash memory version well after the first flash iPods, and that too didn&#8217;t sell well. Now it has an iPod touch competitor 2 years after the iPod touch was released. On paper, it sounds promising right now, but come September 8, it&#8217;s likely to be one-upped by Apple yet again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see how this plays out, sometime next year we&#8217;ll hear about a new Zune HD that has a camera and has app support. The question is will the Zune HD have made any headway into Apple&#8217;s market by then? That is far from a certainty, despite the nice-looking new device.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d really like to know is who plans these events for Microsoft? How on Earth didn&#8217;t they not realize that Apple has an iPod event pretty much every year now in the first few days of September? I&#8217;m sure it would have been a big pain in the ass, but why not put everything you have into ramping up production earlier and getting it to market before Apple can respond?</p>

Sure Macs have Entourage, but the program just doesn't cut it for business users entrenched in the ways of Outlook.  Those set on using a Mac have often resorted to partitioning their hard drives or installing programs like Outlook2Mac to access the program. 

Soon such tactics will no longer be necessary, as Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/aug09/08-13macoutlookpr.mspx" >announced</a> the availability of Outlook in the next version of Mac Office.  The change will likely be implemented in the new version of Office that is set for release in time for the holidays in 2010.  In the mean time, those using Entourage 2008 Web Services Edition will enjoy steps Microsoft has takent towards making the experience more Outlook-like.

The release comes as part of a new business edition of Mac Office designed to provide Mac users with better connection to Microsoft Exchange Server, and improved compatibility across platforms.  Microsoft's Mac unit is also building the Outlook software from the ground up to ensure compatibility with Mac's backup and hard-drive search features.  ]]></description>

It was quite impressive (especially given that the iPhone lacked any search functionaly at all at that point), but the application had a few problems that kept it from really catching on, including a subscription fee and some possible privacy issues (it required users to hand over their Email login credentials).  Today, that changes: reMail is launching an entirely new application on the App Store that should allay any privacy concerns and features a one-time price of $4.99 instead of a subscription.  You can download it <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=324619399&#038;mt=8">here</a>.


The last version of reMail relied on the company's optimized servers, which were much more efficient at running search queries than most Email providers.  However, that technique came with one caveat: it required users to hand over their login credentials.  I pointed this out last time I wrote about the company, figuring that most people probably wouldn't mind too much, but CEO Gabor Cselle says that it was a surprisingly common complaint — people are just unwilling to hand over that login data (which is probably a good thing).  Fortunately, reMail 2.0 does away with this problem.]]></description>

It was quite impressive (especially given that the iPhone lacked any search functionaly at all at that point), but the application had a few problems that kept it from really catching on, including a subscription fee and some possible privacy issues (it required users to hand over their Email login credentials).

You can download it <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=324619399&#038;mt=8">here</a>.</p>
<p>The last version of reMail relied on the company&#8217;s optimized servers, which were much more efficient at running search queries than most Email providers.  However, that technique came with one caveat: it required users to hand over their login credentials.  I pointed this out last time I wrote about the company, figuring that most people probably wouldn&#8217;t mind too much, but CEO Gabor Cselle says that it was a surprisingly common complaint — people are just unwilling to hand over that login data (which is probably a good thing).  Fortunately, reMail 2.0 does away with this problem.</p>
<p>The new version of reMail downloads the entire contents of your Mailbox — every single message — onto your iPhone, which it then stores locally.  That may sound undesirable for those of us with large Email boxes that are many gigabytes large, but the reMail team has done an excellent job at compressing data for its search index: Cselle says that they&#8217;ve managed to squeeze 100,000 Emails into 500 megabytes (most Email accounts are only a fraction of that size).  </p>
<p>To get started, you&#8217;ll have to download your entire mailbox to your phone which will take some time (Cselle recommends setting the phone to Wi-Fi and leaving it over night), but the service will pick up where it left off if you have to have to cut it off mid-way through the download process.  Searching itself works exactly as you&#8217;d hope, showing results only a second or two after you&#8217;ve typed a query, with matching words highlighted.</p>
<p>Of course, the iPhone 3.0 software update finally introduced Email search to the iPhone, which may lead some people to wonder why reMail is even necessary.  Cselle points out a few major benefits: for one, reMail&#8217;s search is around five times faster than the iPhone&#8217;s, and it searches full-text (the iPhone only searches headers).  And reMail retains its full functionally offline, while the iPhone&#8217;s search often requires a data connection to search older messages.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/11/y-combinators-remail-brings-full-text-email-search-to-the-iphone/">written</a> before CEO Gabor Cselle is a guy who really knows Email.  Here&#8217;s a brief bio of Cselle from our last post:</p>
<blockquote><p>He wrote his Master’s thesis on Organizing Email, worked on the Gmail team, and was also VP of Engineering at Xobni, which he left last year to pursue his own company. The company’s backers include Paul Buchheit and Sanjeev Singh, who built a little application called Gmail (they also co-founded FriendFeed). These guys know what they’re doing.</p></blockquote>

In 1901 a Swedish immigrant to America called <a href="http://www.nordstrom.com/">Johan Nordstrom</a> founded the Nordstrom department store. In 1975, by now a national chain, a Nordstrom customer walked into one of their stores to return a set of tyres he’d bought. The salesperson gladly took back the set of car tyres and gave the customer a refund. Nothing weird about that, right? Except Nordstrom has never sold tyres.

Many of you may have heard this story before; it’s one of many legendary tales of great customer service from Nordstrom and best of all it’s true.

According to a chap called <cite>Efraim Turban</cite> “Customer service is a series of activities designed to enhance the level of customer satisfaction – that is, the feeling that a product or service has met the customer expectation.”

Like us all I have copious tales of despair dealing with corporate giants. I’d say the worst offenders used to be banks, but in today’s world of mobile everything, the mobile network operators have definitely claimed that crown. ]]></description>

We've seen two quarters of declines in online advertising revenues, but signs of a recovery, or at least a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">reset</a>, are beginning to show.  In a note today explaining why he is bullish on Google, Citi Internet analyst Mark Mahaney makes the case for cautious optimism.

He predicts stability in search advertising revenues, a significant increase in spending by retail advertisers in both search and display ads, and major growth in mobile ad revenues.  While it is "too early to call the quarter," his checks with search engine marketing firms suggest that overall spending and cost-per-clicks will at least be in line with the second quarter.  ]]></description>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen two quarters of declines in online advertising revenues, but signs of a recovery, or at least a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">reset</a>, are beginning to show.  In a note today explaining why he is bullish on Google, Citi Internet analyst Mark Mahaney makes the case for cautious optimism.</p>
<p>He predicts stability in search advertising revenues, a significant increase in spending by retail advertisers in both search and display ads, and major growth in mobile ad revenues.  While it is &#8220;too early to call the quarter,&#8221; his checks with search engine marketing firms suggest that overall spending and cost-per-clicks will at least be in line with the second quarter.  </p>
<p>On top of that pillar, there is the &#8220;snowballing momentum&#8221; for mobile search ads.  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advertisers are seeing 10X increase in click-thrus via Mobile devices. Mobile Search activity is ramping fast this Smartphone Summer, and ad dollars are following.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is off a small base, but growth is always good.  With all of the new Web phones from the iPhone and Android to the Palm Pre and Blackberry, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/its-gonna-be-a-summer-of-smartphone-love/">Summer of Smartphone Love</a> seems to be paying off.</p>
<p>Finally, Mahaney sees movement in spending budgets among ecommerce companies.  In contrast to 3 percent annual growth in marketing spends among these retailers in the first half of the year, he expects them to ramp up online advertising spending by 20 percent in the second half of the year as they gear up for the holiday season.</p>
<p>But will growth in mobile and retail be enough to move the needle for the entire industry?</p>

In June, Facebook became the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/facebook-is-now-the-fourth-largest-site-in-the-world/">fourth largest site in the world</a> after only Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo sites.  But how did it get there?  Click through the slideshow above to see the advance of the Facebook Death Star across key markets (the U.S., UK, France, Italy, and Spain).  

Each slide shows a snapshot in time, starting with January, 2008 to June or July, 2009. The charts are based on comScore data and show the relative reach (X-axis), usage (y-axis), and time spent (size of bubble) on various popular sites in each market over time.  Facebook is represented by the blue sphere.  You can see how it moves across the Web universe passing sites such as AOL, MySpace, and YouTube (overseas) and getting a larger and larger as it progresses.

<p>In the U.S., Facebook&#8217;s growth continues at a <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/facebook-grew-twice-as-fast-as-twitter-in-july/">remarkable pace</a>, but the changes in the UK and France are the most dramatic.  In the UK, in particular, note how a year ago it was it was neck and neck with Bebo, but by June Bebo had shrunk and lost reach, while Facebook had gone on to pass Yahoo, YouTube, and eBay as well.</p>

The picture, I suppose, looked like an old Dr. Who episode where the action on screen is smoother than the background, creating a jarring disparity when watching movies with lots of movement. It's sometimes called the "Soap Opera Effect." We decided to do a little digging to figure out why.

Most film is recorded at 24 frames per second, but your LCD TV probably either displays at 60 fps or 120 hz (hertz is just a measurement of frequency per second). There are three main ways to cope with this.

First is to simply display each frame longer, this is the oldest technique in LCD tech. However, its undesirable side effects include the possibility of motion blur, or of judder. Judder is an artifact of adjusting the framerate and it looks like a sort of stutter in movement that would otherwise be smooth (a slow pan, for instance).

The second technique is one used on Plasmas and CRT TVs. Instead of showing a bright image the whole time, they display the frame, then a short frame of either darkness or a very dimmed picture. This alleviates much of the issue with judder and motion blur as it allows your brain to fill in the gap faster than you can consciously notice. It is also an old technique, and is used in theaters. It provides the traditional cinema feel.]]></description>

			<title>In A Tight Economy, Outsourced Developers On oDesk  Work 100,000 Hours A Week</title>

The economy may still be trying to pick itself up, but one beneficiary of tighter budgets is outsourcing marketplace <a href="http://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a>.  Web developers and software engineers looking for project work can find jobs on oDesk, and employers can post jobs.  Workers download PC-monitoring software which lets employers keep track of exactly how long they are on the job, even if it is in their pajamas at 3 AM.

As a result, oDesk publishes aggregate data on the "oConomy"  and how many <a href="http://www.odesk.com/community/oconomy/odesk_growth">collective hours a week</a> are being billed through its service. In July, the hours worked on oDesk surpassed 100,000 a week for the first time, and $65 million worth of work was posted on the site.]]></description>

<p>The economy may still be trying to pick itself up, but one beneficiary of tighter budgets is outsourcing marketplace <a href="http://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a>.  Web developers and software engineers looking for project work can find jobs on oDesk, and employers can post jobs.  Workers download PC-monitoring software which lets employers keep track of exactly how long they are on the job, even if it is in their pajamas at 3 AM.</p>
<p>As a result, oDesk publishes aggregate data on the &#8220;oConomy&#8221;  and how many <a href="http://www.odesk.com/community/oconomy/odesk_growth">collective hours a week</a> are being billed through its service. In July, the hours worked on oDesk surpassed 100,000 a week for the first time, and $65 million worth of work was posted on the site.  In contrast, oDesk workers are earning about $6 million a week (because the value of job postings is for the entire job and not all get filled).  oDesk takes a 10 percent cut, implying an annual revenue run rate of $7 million or $8 million.</p>
<p>That is still a drop in the bucket of the overall tech economy, but it is an indication that outsourcing is growing in the down economy.  Competitor Elance, which covers a broader set of industries, shows similar <a href=" http://www.elance.com/skills_central">trends</a>.  </p>
<p>oDesk is backed by Benchmark Capital and has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/odesk">$29 million</a>, most recently a <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/04/odesk-raises-15m-more-for-outsourcing-development/">$15 million round</a> last year.</p>

<big><strong>OurShelf</strong></big><br />
URL:  <a href="http://ou.rshelf.com">http://ou.rshelf.com</a></p>
<p>OurShelf is a social cataloging site that lets users manage their belongings, lend or find the items they need faster and cheaper. Users save money from borrowing short-use items such as books, music, movies, and videogames from friends and they make money from selling their unused items to multiple third-party sites, like eBay and Craigslist.</p>
<p>The site provides users with a digital shelf. They can catalog their belongings through an import functionality or OurShelf&#8217;s search engine. A populated shelf allows users to create a highly personalized shopping and item management experience. OurShelf achieves this by laying an item graph (complete with related items and reviews) over a social graph. It’s like del.icio.us, except for the physical goods users own.</p>
<p>OurShelf is in public beta.</p>

<p>For many people, the amount of information coming into their inboxes is overwhelming. And for news-tracking professionals and resource-strapped small businesses, this information overload costs precious time and money.  There has to be something better than Google Alerts.</p>
<p>Parse.ly is a tool that tries to understand users&#8217; unique interests to filter and prioritize content from thousands of news and blog sources across the web.  Parse.ly always tries to show users the content most relevant to their interests first, so they will spend less time on low-value items.</p>
<p>Parse.ly also automatically learns users interests, and recommends increasingly relevant content over time.  Moreover, Parse.ly is designed with a spare web interface to provide people with the most productive reading experience.</p>

In addition, marketers and entrepreneurs can view and respond to comments left by readers across various social media.</p>
<p>Small business owners told the Postling team that they would be willing to pay for a social media marketing tool that saves them time and spares them from learning how to navigate yet another website. They listened and created Postling.  The service costs $9/month or $90/year.</p>

URL:  <a href="http://SeatGeek.com">http://SeatGeek.com</a></p>
<p>SeatGeek is a web application that forecasts sports and concert ticket prices on the secondary market, analogous to what Farecast (now Bing Travel) does for airline tickets. For ticket buyers, this application helps them determine whether they should buy a ticket now or wait until the price drops. For sellers, it helps them identify the optimal time to sell their tickets and increase their profits margins.</p>
<p>SeatGeek’s crawlers have compiled millions of ticket transactions and have also aggregated other factors that influence ticket prices.  SeatGeek&#8217;s patent-pending technology uses this data in an algorithm that attempts to accurately predict ticket prices.</p>
<p>Currently, SeatGeek offers a free version for ticket buyers that is monetized through affiliate fees.  In October it is launching a premium subscription service for brokers and other ticket sellers</p>

<p>Regardless, whatever this is or isn&#8217;t, I want this. I was unsure if the app model would be better or worse than running a version of regular OS X on the Apple Tablet, but I&#8217;m definitely leaning towards better recently. And after seeing this, I hope Apple is too.</p>

And the main key to all of this is its rich APIs, <a href="http://cheddargetter.com/api">which you can read about here</a>.</p>
<p>Using CheddarGetter, you won&#8217;t have to worry about declined credit cards, coding for pricing changes, handling trial times and all the complicated stuff that comes with payments. And the services does things like automate email sending for confirmations, and gives you an analytics package, to make your job easier.</p>
<p>The key part aside from ease of use is obviously cost. And CheddarGetter sounds pretty compelling with prices starting at $39 a month. Larger rivals can charge hundreds of dollars a month for the same services. And CheddarGetter has no setup fees, transaction fees or percentage fees. It&#8217;s simply the $39 a month and then forget about it — assuming you stay small.</p>
<p>If your startup takes off and you need to manage beyond 1,000 customers, the prices obviously go up. The Advanced package is $169.00 a month for up to 10,000 customers, and the Premium package is $549.99 a month for up to 50,000 customers. Or, if you only slightly go over the alloted number of users, there is a small per-customer overage fee you can choose to pay rather than upgrading. And no matter what payment scale you&#8217;re on, there are zero transaction and setup fees.</p>
<p>CheddarGetter is the first startup to launch from <a href="http://www.sproutbox.com/">SproutBox</a>, an Indiana-based incubator. It&#8217;s currently <a href="http://www.sproutbox.com/apply">accepting applications</a> for a new crop of early-stage startups, but hurry, the deadline is August 15.</p>
<p>The service isn&#8217;t set to launch until September, but we have 100 invites to give away now. Simply visit <a href="https://cheddargetter.com/user/signup">this page</a> and use the code TECHCRUNCH1 in the &#8216;Got a Beta Code?&#8217; box.</p>

It was only a matter of time.  Over <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/facebook-testing-virtual-gifts/">two years</a> after its virtual goods marketplace opened, Facebook has cast away its innocence and started to sell virtual gifts emblazoned with celebrity faces and paraphernalia.  Leading the charge is worldwide music star Britney Spears, who now has six gifts prominently appearing in the marketplace.  </p>
<p>Britney&#8217;s set of gifts was designed in collaboration with Susan Kare, the famed designer responsible for creating the icons on the original Macintosh, as well as many of Facebook&#8217;s other virtual gifts.  The initial selection includes a schoolgirl outfit, a birthday cake, a multicolored balloon, and a classic shot of Britney&#8217;s performance with a boa constrictor.  And in case you were worried that these digital masterpieces were somehow counterfeited, fear not: the press release we received says that they were all &#8220;signed by Spears herself&#8221;.  Seriously.</p>
<p>Of course, these will sell like hotcakes to Britney&#8217;s legions of fans (she has over 2 million on Facebook alone).  And they&#8217;ll also likely get a fair bit of use from mischievous young men who will send them to their friends and giggle incessantly.  Either way, Britney and Facebook win: each gift costs $2 (most gifts cost half that), and you can be sure Britney is getting a piece of the action.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we see a bevy of other celebrities sporting their own sets of gifts.  And in a way, it&#8217;s sort of sad — I&#8217;ve always enjoyed virtual gifts because they were charming, featuring things like cupcakes and penguins.  Granted, there have certainly been some corporate sponsored gifts (someone gave me Coors Light bottlecap at some point), but even then they were usually hand drawn.  The photographs of Britney just look out of place.</p>

<p>The genetic testing startup has agreed to donate $1 for each of the first 500 unique tweets that use the hastags <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23blamedrewscancer">#blamedrewscancer</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=I+%23BlameDrewsCancer+for+SOMETHING+%2323andMe" target="_blank">#23andMe</a>. These tweets will start counting after the site reaches its 10,000 person who has tweeted for the cause, which will be sometime tonight. The money will go towards the LIVESTRONG foundation for cancer research.</p>
<p>23andMe is also donating 5 of its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/23andme-launches-99-kit-to-spur-its-research-revolution/">new $99 research kits</a>, to be raffled away to Blame Drew&#8217;s Cancer followers, also to benefit the LIVESTRONG foundation. Along with that, 23andMe is donating a kit to the namesake of Blame Drew&#8217;s Cancer, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/drew-olanoff">Drew Olanoff</a>, to add his results to their <a href="https://www.23andme.com/researchrevolution/">Research Revolution project</a>. And soon you&#8217;ll be able to buy the $99 kits through the Blame Drew&#8217;s Cancer site, with $5 of each sale going to LIVESTRONG, Olanoff tells us.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that, 23andMe has agreed to be the main sponsor of Olanoff&#8217;s 24-hour <a href="http://www.blame-a-thon.com/">Blame-a-thon</a> happening on 9-9-09, and being streamed live to the web.</p>
<p>This is another example of Twitter being used for charitable purposes. Last week, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/twitcause-is-yes-a-causes-for-twitter/">we wrote about TwitCause</a>, a service that wants to spread the word about various good causes on Twitter — much like Causes does on Facebook and MySpace.

But that's hardly all this update contains. You can also now easily send feed items to a number of places including Facebook, MySpace, Digg, StumbleUpon, Blogger, and others.

If the services you want aren't listed, you can even customize the "Send To" feature to enable sending items just about anywhere.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-91875" title="picture-37" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-37.png" alt="picture-37" width="398" height="276" />A few days ago, I sent out <a href="http://twitter.com/parislemon/statuses/3162731997">a tweet</a> wondering how long it would be until Google Reader added a tweet button to the bottom of each feed item. My guess was that it would be very soon. I was quite right. Today, the Google Reader team has <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/08/flurry-of-features-for-feed-readers.html">unveiled</a> a bunch of new updates to the product, including, yes, the ability to easily tweet any item.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s hardly all this update contains. You can also now easily send feed items to a number of places including Facebook, MySpace, Digg, StumbleUpon, Blogger, and others. To enable any of these, simply go to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; area of Google Reader and enable the ones you want to use. If the services you want aren&#8217;t listed, you can even customize the &#8220;Send To&#8221; feature to enable sending items just about anywhere.</p>
<p>Another new feature allows you to easily subscribe to feeds owned by people you are contacts with. This is an obvious, but nice addition, as it makes it easier to locate feeds you may be interested in — assuming, of course, that you&#8217;re actually interested in the people you follow on Google Reader. This feature also includes Twitter updates, so you can easily import all of those and see that person&#8217;s tweets through Google Reader if you don&#8217;t feel like scanning Twitter all day.</p>
<p>But the best feature of the bunch may be the ability to have more control over the &#8220;Mark all as read&#8221; functionality. We all use the &#8220;Mark all as read&#8221; button when we&#8217;re too far behind on our feeds to possibly catch up. But now you can just mark items that older than a day, a week, or two weeks as read, saving the newest ones for you to still be able to read. That&#8217;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Google Reader still has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/google-reader-takes-another-social-step-with-people-search-and-likes/">some</a> social <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/20/people-are-using-google-reader-likes-but-some-hate-it-and-its-flawed/">issues</a>, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with any of these features.</p>

With that in mind, it's a bit surprising that the site hasn't done a better job at featuring this ridiculously popular functionality — instead of placing the search box at the far left or right side of the screen, as most sites do, YouTube has instead tucked it a bit off center, embedded in its somewhat cluttered masthead.  In light of this, YouTube has decided to totally revamp the design of the top of its homepage, and will be rolling out a new version today.


The new version has eliminated most of the clutter and color of the old design, in favor of something that's unquestionably more <i>Googleish</i>.  Before now, navigation buttons like "Home" and "Videos" were likely the first thing people looked at — now, there's no question that the default action on the site is going to be search.

The layout also does a better job categorizing the main features of the site: the left side is now dedicated to finding videos, the right is dedicated to uploading and managing the clips you&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>It may not sound like a huge deal, but just as very small tweaks on Google can have a major effect, a minor change to YouTube&#8217;s design may well change the way people use the site.  I won&#8217;t be surprised if YouTube sees a marked boost in search queries as a result of the new masthead.<br />

<p>As we noted last week, OS X 10.5.8 was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/as-snow-leopard-lurks-os-x-leopard-goes-1058/">likely to be the last update</a> before OS X 10.6 dropped. But an August ship date would certainly be a welcomed surprise. That would also mean nearly a full 2 month head start over Windows 7, which is scheduled to ship October 22. August 28 is also just two weeks from this Friday, so if Apple is really going to launch it then, expect some kind of press release in the next few days.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/12/sources_detail_changes_to_snow_leopard_installation_process.html">AppleInsider gave some details</a> about the Snow Leopard installation process, which apparently has quite a few differences from the OS X Leopard install.</p>
<p>OS X Snow Leopard is going to sell for only $29.99, as Apple is considering it mostly a performance upgrade over OS X Leopard. But the performance improvements are expected to be significant, and the footprint of the install has been significantly reduced (due mostly to the fact that it&#8217;s Intel-only).</p>

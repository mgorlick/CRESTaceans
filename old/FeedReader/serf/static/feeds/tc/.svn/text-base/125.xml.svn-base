					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twolves.png" class="shot2"/>Every day, sports fans congregate at their nearest big-league stadium to bask in each other&#8217;s cheers, body paint, and beer, relishing their shared enthusiasm for the teams they love.  But then the game ends.  Everyone is forced to head back to their normal lives to trudge through their day jobs once more, at least til the next home game comes round.  Social media can offer them some comfort, giving them a chance to take the community home with them.  Unfortunately, many professional sports teams are still failing to tap into this effectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fanchatter.com">FanChatter</a>, a <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded company that&#8217;s launching today, is a startup that&#8217;s looking to help fix this problem.  The company is focused on helping major sports teams increase engagement both during and after games using user-submitted content, Twitter, and other social services.  And while the company is still quite new, it&#8217;s already got some major customers, including the Minnesota Twins, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the University of Oaklahoma. </p>
<p>One of the site&#8217;s core features is its photo gallery.  During games, fans are encouraged to Email photos taken from their cell phones to a designated Email address, for the chance to have their photos appear on the stadium&#8217;s Jumbotron.  Teams receive the photos in real-time and build photo galleries from them, which they can then use in place of the candid video shots we&#8217;ve all seen so many times between innings or during a time-out.  Obviously teams aren&#8217;t able to display <i>every</i> photo submitted, but FanChatter also takes these photos and builds a shared photo album — one for each game — which can then be accessed by fans from the team&#8217;s home page.  You can see what these albums look like by checking out the Twins&#8217; page <a href="http://twins.fanchatter.com/">here</a>.  Fans will also soon be able to share their videos taken at the game, though these likely won&#8217;t be appearing on the Jumbotron as they take too long to filter through.</p>
<p>Another of the company&#8217;s features is the ChatterBox, a widget that can display a stream of tweets relevant to a particular hashtag or topic (the Timberwolves have one that shows tweets with the tag #twolves).  Fans can use this to communicate during the game, and to follow the latest news from home.  The widget is similar to one that&#8217;s offered by <a href="http://www.tinker.com">Tinker</a>, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/30/tinker-gives-twitter-its-long-awaited-events-firehose/">launched</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>FanChatter licenses its technology with fees set on a case-by-case basis, and has plans to extend its technology beyond sports to include other major events, like concerts.  It also has plans to roll out iPhone applications, which would give fans a better way to interact with each other while they&#8217;re still at the game.<br />

By which I mean, I feel like my insides aren't fully developed, I have no strength in my arms or legs and the idea of eating solid food is just a distant dream.

It's all <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/silicon-valley-its-time-to-clean-up/">Lacy's fault</a>, of course, she actually pays for this nonsense every month or so and claims it's the reason why she no longer gets sick when she travels. Arrington and Heather apparently swear by it too.

The rest of TechCrunch, meanwhile, are beyond skeptical, bandying around words like "science" and "proof" in a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that they're in the pay of Big Cheeseburger. Whatever the truth, I've bet Lacy fifty dollars that the only thing the cleanse will achieve for me is crippling hunger and a loss of feeling in my extremities, so I'm in for the duration. At least as I lie on my deathbed, puking water and romaine-and-celery juice into a cardboard bowl, I can comfort myself with the fact that it was free - a promotion by the company to tempt California-based hacks into starving themselves to death. Journalistic freebies for the win (see my statement of ethics: <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/hack-to-the-future-my-long-overdue-statement-of-ethics/">here</a>).

Speaking of ethics, I'm just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as 'Geeks At The Beach', the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don't. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up 'influential' social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it's heading next. In Los Angeles.

<p>Speaking of ethics, I&#8217;m just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as &#8216;Geeks At The Beach&#8217;, the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don&#8217;t. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up &#8216;influential&#8217; social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it&#8217;s heading next. In Los Angeles. On a beach.</p>
<p>Lacy and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> would be there - so far, so good - but so too would Seaworld-friendly haircaster, <a href="http://julia.nonsociety.com">Julia Allison</a>; LA-based red-carpet dweller, <a href="http://www.ShiraLazar.com">Shira Lazar</a> and various life-casters and me-bloggers whose existence I was only dimly aware of. I hesitated for a moment in accepting: what was supposed to be a meeting of minds could very easily be a train wreck of egos and bikinis and Flipcams and bullshit. Or, to put it another way: the best. column. ever. Count me in.</p>
<p>As it turned out, my worries were only half founded. Yes, there were Flipcams, and lots of egos and bullshit - these were bloggers and life-casters, after all. Yes, at one point the conversation touched a little too closely on whether cupcakes were more or less important than politics in driving community discussions. And yes, certainly, some of those in attendance were clearly more interested in the beach part than the geeks part of the event. But as the day went on, a hardcore group of us - including but certainly not limited to me, Scoble, Lacy and J.R. - really did get down to some proper, substantive debate over two issues that occupy almost every day of our lives. The first was Internet anonymity - my thoughts on which you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/nsfw-bringing-nothing-to-techcrunch-and-a-brand-new-reality-to-the-unter-trolls">enjoyed last week</a> - and the second was the future of journalism, and how life-casting and unpaid blogging most certainly isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a horribly pompous misconception amongst bloggers that they are somehow &#8216;taking on the mainstream media&#8217;. &#8220;Those old losers just don&#8217;t get it!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;We bloggers are on the scene first, asking tough questions before the mainstream media have even put their shoes on&#8221;. Indeed, as uber-blogger Scoble pointed out, taking another sip from his glass of free sake, there were no AP photographers on the plane that went down in the Hudson.</p>
<p>When it comes to a certain type of highly visible breaking news, no-one can argue that social media kicks the mainstream media&#8217;s ass. At any given disaster, there&#8217;s possibly a 0.01% chance that a professional journalist or photographer will already be on the scene, compared to 100% odds that there&#8217;ll be some dude with a camera-phone there. And as for asking tough questions: yep, bloggers are pretty good at that too - hardly a syllable can slip from the mouth of a politician or public official without it being torn apart by an army of &#8216;fact-checking&#8217; bloggers, hungry for content. </p>
<p>And yet, I argued back, after camera phone dude helps us establish that the plane has crashed, who can we trust to tell us <em>why</em> it happened? While bloggers can own the first five minutes of any breaking story - a plane crash, a fire, a burglary - it&#8217;s always going to be the professional reporters who own the next five days, or five weeks. They walk the streets, work their contacts and - yes -  trawl the blogosphere for eye-witness reports, and then take all of that information, analyse it, follow it up and ultimately provide an account of events that readers can trust.</p>
<p>Or at least this is what they used to do. If that were still how journalism works then the unpaid bloggers wouldn&#8217;t have a hope of competing. But unfortunately, thanks to a succession of journalistic fakes and the constant tabloidisation of the press, that trust is gone. Why should someone - either an advertiser or a reader - be prepared to pay for a newspaper when they can get the same old lies and fluff from the blogosphere?</p>
<p>As we sat in Los Angeles, debating how to save what remains of professional journalism, Michael Arrington was posting one possible solution on this very blog. In a post titled &#8216;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/what-if-the-new-new-york-times">What If: The New New York Times</a>&#8216; he argued that the New York Times should lay off all but 50 of its reporters, leaving behind the crack team of superstar hacks who truly drive the paper&#8217;s value. These cuts, he said, would allow the remaining reporters to be paid a generous wage for their work, thus solving the twin questions of trust and of how to pay for good journalism in future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice idea, but one that overlooks the fact that a superstar hack takes days - or weeks - of legwork to get to the bottom of a single story. Without content from workaday photographers or wire-feed-re-writers, the New New York Times would be three pages long and published weekly. Good journalism is a slow, labour-intensive business. And what about unglamourous local stories? Let&#8217;s not forget that the two most famous reporters of all time - Woodward and Bernstein - were junior reporters when the broke their most famous story: Watergate. A story, let&#8217;s also not forget, that began life as a dull local burglary. Which of the 50 top flight hacks would have been assigned to that?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t matter how you twist it, there&#8217;s simply no way for the New York Times to regain its position as the news reporter of record in the Internet era. Instead, if Mike really wants to save the Times, while simultaneously seeing the future of journalism, he should look a little closer to home. </p>
<p>To TechCrunch in fact. </p>
<p>Because while TechCrunch might be &#8216;just&#8217; a blog it&#8217;s also, as I&#8217;ve discovered in the past few weeks, a hell of a professional journalistic machine. Whatever the cynics might think, it&#8217;s a place where sources are built up, facts are checked, lawyers are employed and writers are encouraged to go out and get the real story behind the story. It&#8217;s also on something of a hiring spree at the moment - looking out at traditional media and cherry picking those (ahem) who it thinks can bring more value to the brand. In doing so, TechCrunch is one of a handful of tech blogs that commands solid advertising revenues and has - by and large - build up huge trust amongst readers. Trust which allows it to host events like TechCrunch 50, bringing in even more money to support the site&#8217;s journalism.</p>
<p>Right across the Internet there are countless other sites that employ the same standards for other niches - from music (<a href="http://www.pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a>) to politics (<a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a>) to farming (I have no idea) - each of which can afford to dedicate more time to their very specific field of expertise than the New York Times could, even if it doubled its staff.</p>
<p>And so if I were the New York Times, I&#8217;d realise that in the face of such solid niche competition, my days as a news-gatherer were over. I&#8217;d lay off all of my journalists, shut down the presses (a move favoured by Lacy during a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jul/08/journalism-internet-socialmedia-businessmodels">recent Guardian podcast</a>), close the doors and thank God for giving me such a good innings. Then the next day I&#8217;d round up maybe 20 or 30 of my best editors and I&#8217;d launch a brand new site. A site which, like a far more mainstream <a href="http://www.aldaily.com/">Arts and Letters Daily</a>, would use those skilled human editors to aggregate the best specialist reporting from around the web into one all-encompassing news source.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d link to posts on TechCrunch, and Pitchfork and FiveThirtyEight and on any other site that my professional editors had determined was providing the best coverage of each of the days most important stories. And I&#8217;d work hard - really hard - to rebuild my brand credibility so that readers knew that they could absolutely trust the reporting on any site that had been selected by editors. All the news that&#8217;s fit to link.</p>
<p>For the New York Times, the cost in doing all of this would be limited to retaining the 30 best editors in the business, and the small support staff required to keep them productive - costs easily covered thanks to the millions of eyeballs that would visit just such a site every day, hungry for news sources they can actually trust.</p>
<p>For the specialist sites being linked to, the boost in traffic and credibility would only bring more targeted advertising revenue and more possibilities for spin off events, books and the rest, all of which contribute to the journalistic bottom line and their ability to hire from the army of recently unemployed journalists.</p>
<p>And as for the life-casters and amateur bloggers - they can keep having their fun too; contributing user generated content to the niche sites, and then re-parsing the coverage on their own blogs, Twitter stream or - in Scoble&#8217;s case - FriendFeed. It&#8217;s a solution where every one&#8217;s a winner. Except for the life casters, who by and large will remain losers.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no reason the aggregating site has to be created by the New York Times; anyone with some high-level editorial experience could do it. Equally there&#8217;s no reason why there can&#8217;t be dozens of these aggregators, each with their own editorial voice: one for liberals, one for conservatives, one for wealthy Brits, one for college kids in Guatemala. The point is that the days of the profitable generalist news-gatherer are dying, but the days of solid reporting and a strong, trusted editorial voice must never be allowed to perish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a point that&#8217;s so important it kept a group of us arguing until the early hours in Los Angeles, and so important that the possible solution has been bouncing around my head ever since. Hell, it&#8217;s so important that I feel like getting up from my desk right now and hitting the streets looking for the perfect newsman-turned-entrepreneur to make it happen.</p>
<p>If only I wasn&#8217;t on this stupid juice cleanse and hadn&#8217;t lost the use of my legs.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88809" title="picture-32" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-32.png" alt="picture-32" width="328" height="452" />The existence of Apple&#8217;s new so-called &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; music experience being created with the major record labels seemed to create headlines last week more for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/are-apple-and-the-music-labels-mixing-holiday-cocktails-on-the-tablet/">side-talk about the Apple tablet</a>, than the music element itself. And for good reason, because just as we wrote last week, it&#8217;s starting to sound like this is mainly another ploy to pull more money out of consumers&#8217; pockets.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, it&#8217;s also starting to sound like the music industry may be taking a cue from the rise of mobile applications, to position this new format.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE5701KE20090801">Reuters has a new report</a> today about the Cocktail plan. After you wade through the usual PR speak from music execs about how this will change the digital music experience for consumers, you get to the real nugget of information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will the Cocktail format drive greater digital album sales? Probably not, but that&#8217;s not what the music industry is expecting from it. Instead, label sources position it as a way to further monetize existing digital album purchases. While pricing information isn&#8217;t available, Cocktail-formatted albums will almost certainly cost more than the standard album available on iTunes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there something to be said for the missing experience of opening a record or CD for the first time, and checking out things like the artwork? Of course. But if the industry execs really cared about that, they&#8217;d come up with a standard to offer that without jacking up prices on consumers to give them a better experience.</p>
<p>Instead, they have likely come up with a way to charge more for content, while wrapping it in some new marketing. And while the execs and most outlets are mostly pushing the Apple angle specifically, the idea is to get these new types of digital albums to all the big digital music outlets, as Greg Sandoval <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10296045-93.html">reported last week</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s smart to push Apple&#8217;s role in this because it sounds like it is doing things a little differently than what the music labels plan to do with the rest of the outlets. And it seems like a good bet that Apple&#8217;s version could offer a better experience than the others. The reason is that Apple&#8217;s digital content is so tightly integrated with its devices. So something like Cocktail on an iPhone or iPod touch could be a lot nicer than simply trying to run it on a computer or a less capable mobile media player.</p>
<p>And from what&#8217;s being said about all of this, it&#8217;s starting to sound like these Cocktails may actually be album apps of sorts, that you open and interact with while listening to the music. Again, Apple has already proven itself in the app game.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this new format takes off in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, but don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking that the prime motivation for this is anything but a way for the labels to make more money.</p>

<p>Right about now, Apple probably wishes it had never <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected Google Voice</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">related apps</a> from the iPhone.  Or maybe it was AT&#038;T who rejected the apps.  Nobody really knows.  But the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an investigation</a> last night to find out, sending letters to all three companies (Apple, AT&#038;T, and Google) asking them to explain exactly what happened.</p>
<p>On its face, it might seem odd to some people that the FCC is investigating the rejection of a single iPhone app.  After all, iPhone apps are rejected every day.  But the Google Voice rejection caused an unusual amount of <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090727/p90#a090727p90">uproar</a>, and there is nothing like a high-profile case to make an example out of in pursuit of pushing a bigger policy agenda.  The FCC investigation is not just about the arbitrary rejection of a single app.  It is the FCC&#8217;s way of putting a stake in the ground for making the wireless networks controlled by cell phone carriers as open as the Internet.</p>
<p>Today there are two different sets of rules for applications and devices on the Internet.  On the wired Internet, we can connect any type of PC or other computing device and use any applications we want on those devices.  On the wireless Internet controlled by cellular carriers like AT&#038;T, we can only use the phones they allow on their networks and can only use the applications they approve.  This was fine when the wireless networks were used mostly just for voice calls.  But now that they are increasingly becoming our mobile connections to the Internet and mobile phones are becoming full-fledged mobile computers, an argument has been growing that the same rules of open access that rule the wired Internet should apply to the wireless Internet.</p>
<p>While Apple and AT&#038;T cannot be too happy about the FCC investigation, Google must secretly be pleased as punch.  It was only two years ago, prior to the 700MHz wireless spectrum auctions, that it was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">pleading with the FCC</a> to adopt principles guaranteeing open access for applications, devices, services, and other networks. Now two years later, in a different context and under a different administration, the FCC is pushing for the same principles.</p>
<p>In its letters requesting more information from all three companies, the FCC cites &#8220;pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497).  That first proceeding on open access dates back to 2007 when <a href=" http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/02/22/skype-begs-fcc-to-open-cell-networks/">Skype requested</a> that cell phone carriers open up their networks to all applications (see <a href=" http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:WMsHzJyFR6IJ:www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/pisc-skype-comments-20070430.pdf+RM-11361&#038;cd=2&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=us&#038;client=firefox-a">Skype&#8217;s petition here</a>).  Like Google Voice, Skype helps consumers bypass the carriers.  The carriers don&#8217;t like that because it erodes their core business and turns them into dumb pipes.</p>
<p>But dumb pipes are what we need.  They are good for consumers and good for competition because they allow any application and any device, within reason, to flower on the wireless Internet.  So if you look at the questions the FCC is asking, it wants to know why the Google Voice app was rejected and whether AT&#038;T (the carrier) had anything to do with that rejection:</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&#038;T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications? . . . </p>
<p>3. Does AT&#038;T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)?  If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play? </p></blockquote>
<p>The FCC also wants Apple to explain the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">arbitrariness</a> of its app approval process:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone.  Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&#038;T’s 3G network?</p>
<p>5. What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons?  Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers?  If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers?</p>
<p>6. What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications?   What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)?  What is the percentage of applications that are rejected?  What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?</p></blockquote>
<p>Good questions.  Hopefully, the FCC will share Apple&#8217;s answers with the rest of the us.  It is all a bit absurd, though.  Why does it take a formal request from a government agency to get Apple (and AT&#038;T) to explain what the rules are to get on the wireless Internet?  More importantly, why are these companies allowed to be the gatekeepers to the wireless Internet?   The iPhone needs to be smashed open, and the FCC is swinging the hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AT&#038;T responded to this post with the following statements:</p>
<blockquote><p>
AT&#038;T does not manage or approve applications for the App Store. We have received the letter and will, of course, respond to it.</p>
<p>Customers can use any compatible GSM phone on our network, not just the ones we’ve approved and sell.  And they also can use apps we don’t approve.  We don’t approve iPhone applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. You can use any mobile app you like on AT&#038;T—unless it is an iPhone app (that&#8217;s been rejected by Apple).  Does Apple ever reject apps at the request of AT&#038;T though?  Maybe they&#8217;ll give the FCC a straight answer.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr-215x141.jpg" width="215" height="141" />Ever since I've started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I've been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it's not getting any better. 

It's not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.

When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given 'best practice' and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr.jpg" class="shot2" />Ever since I&#8217;ve started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I&#8217;ve been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it&#8217;s not getting any better. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.</p>
<p>When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given &#8216;best practice&#8217; and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible. Regular TechCrunch readers know <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/04/the-reality-of-pr-smile-dial-name-drop-pray/">how we think about the PR industry</a> - and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/lois-whitman-now-an-unwilling-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-pr/">some of its proponents</a> - in today&#8217;s world, and in particular <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/">our stance towards embargoes</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle a different problem in this post, one that reporters from around the world, whatever field they cover, will no doubt recognize. The issue I have with press releases, and the reason I think they are a thing of the distant past in their current form, is that they basically all look alike. Sure, the companies that are talked about can be different, and the type of news coming from them can be different, but the copy, form and style are often so much alike that for large parts of the announcements you could just as easily swap the names of the companies and keep the rest of the words. Oftentimes, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with press releases is that for basically as long as they&#8217;ve been around, they&#8217;ve contained the same damn words, rendering them completely meaningless in most cases and contexts. I wonder what the world would be like if these words were henceforth permanently banned from all press releases:</p>
<p><strong>1 ) LEADING / LEADER</strong></p>
<p>You know the kind: <em>&#8220;Initech, the leading blah in blah blah blah, has partnered with Initrode, leader in blah blah blahblah blah blah blah.&#8221;</em> Every single time a press release carries either one of these words in the first sentence, I cringe. Why? Because if everyone is leading, no one is. Period. PR people, next time you start writing a news announcement, ask yourself if you really should be using the words &#8216;leading&#8217; or &#8216;leader&#8217; just because it&#8217;s easy and everyone is doing it.</p>
<p><strong>2 ) BEST / MOST / FASTEST / LARGEST / BIGGEST / etc.</strong></p>
<p>Emphasizing the strengths of the company you&#8217;re pitching is obviously a good thing. But does anyone realize how meaningless these terms become when they are followed up by something so blatantly untrue or tied to a small niche that it&#8217;s just painful to read? I&#8217;m specifically thinking about press releases that commence with something like <em>&#8220;Initech, the largest manufacturer of red staplers engraved with our company logo, has just won the Buzo Award for the most uncreative use of the word &#8216;largest&#8217; in the history of mankind.&#8221;</em> Handle these words with care.</p>
<p><strong>3 ) INNOVATIVE / INNOVATION</strong></p>
<p>The mother of all voidness. How many truly innovative products are launched on a yearly basis, regardless of the sector? How many times have you seen something get the &#8216;innovation&#8217; label without merit? Unless you or your clients find a cure for all cancers, simply stop using it, starting today. Now that would be innovative.</p>
<p><strong>4 ) REVOLUTIONARY</strong></p>
<p>Much like the above, terrible word to be using in press releases. What exactly about your product is going to make people leave their houses to demonstrate, oppose their government, riot, etc.? Oh, sorry, you mean the company you&#8217;re pitching is not going to change the world but it is going to completely change the way an industry thinks about your business? Safe bet: it&#8217;s not going to. Likely you&#8217;re just doing the old &#8216;wishful thinking&#8217; routine, and everyone knows you are.</p>
<p><strong>5 ) AWARD-WINNING</strong></p>
<p>Trust me, telling anyone willing to listen that you&#8217;ve been recognized with this or that award won&#8217;t be providing you with any goodwill right off the bat. There are exceptions to this rule, but very few (they include the Nobel Prize, a Pulitzer, a <a href="http://crunchies2008.techcrunch.com/">Crunchie</a> or a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/announcing-the-europas-the-techcrunch-europe-awards-2009/">Europa Award</a>). Basically it&#8217;s like going around a party informing everyone that you&#8217;ve had sex with a human being last week: I&#8217;m sure it matters to you a great deal - and hopefully to the other person as well - but the rest of us likely don&#8217;t give a hoot. We also think it&#8217;s kind of sad that you are looking for someone to confirm or recognize your accomplishments that way. A tip: unless you&#8217;re announcing that you&#8217;ve actually won an award (which by the way is only very rarely newsworthy), leave it out.</p>
<p><strong>6 ) DISRUPTIVE / DISRUPTION</strong></p>
<p>Newsflash: a product or service is only very, very, very rarely disruptive. If there is a truly ground-breaking one, it&#8217;s also never disruptive out of the gate, for it can take years or even decades to turn an entire industry upside down. The fact that you&#8217;d use the word in a press release speaks volumes about your ability to tell your head from your ass: anything truly disruptive doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and you can&#8217;t capture &#8216;disruption&#8217; in a news announcement pushed out at a given time and date. Besides, if something is genuinely disruptive I&#8217;m sure it will require little push from PR people or firms to get the word out there.</p>
<p><strong>7 ) CUTTING / BLEEDING EDGE</strong></p>
<p>In the same boat as the words &#8216;innovative&#8217;, &#8216;revolutionary&#8217; and &#8216;disruptive&#8217;: so often misused in the past that it now looks like you&#8217;re practicing your skills to write quality satire when you use it to tout a company or product in a press release. </p>
<p><strong>8 ) NEXT-GENERATION</strong></p>
<p>Overused. If you have an updated version of your product to announce, why not just say so? I simply cannot understand what people are trying to tell me when they say their new release is &#8216;next-gen&#8217;. Is it too advanced or complex for me to use and will only young children have the ability to understand what you&#8217;re doing when they grow up? Did your previous product version stink so bad that you needed to skip an entire generation of iterations to finally get it right?</p>
<p><strong>9 ) STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>Partnering with other companies can be good - and newsworthy too, though not often - but it doesn&#8217;t help you get more attention or goodwill when you announce a <em>strategic</em> partnership, agreement or relationship. We&#8217;re assuming it fits in both your strategy and the one of the company or companies you team up with, otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be forming an alliance, right? It&#8217;s not like your agreement suddenly gets a whole other dimension because it&#8217;s labeled &#8217;strategic&#8217;, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>10 ) SYNERGY</strong></p>
<p>Simply defined, synergy means that the whole in combination is greater than the sum of the individual parts working on their own. Used properly, the word can describe the magnified effects of two drugs taken together, parasites that enforce each other’s destructive effects and compounded health risks due to toxic chemicals. When applied to corporations, it means a financial benefit that a company aims to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation. As history teaches us, there’s rarely any synergy involved when companies melt together or one takes over the other (cough, AOL-Time Warner). PR people, you’d be doing yourself a serious favor banning this one from all future press releases.</p>
<p>Bonus words: enterprise-grade, world-class, turnkey, premier, unparalleled and unrivaled.</p>
<p>Can you think of any others that should be given the kibosh? </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> awesome! <a href="http://www.davidmeermanscott.com/documents/3703Gobbledygook.pdf">The Gobbledygook Manifesto</a> (PDF) by <a href="http://www.davidmeermanscott.com/products_ebooks.htm">David Meerman Scott</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you have links to press releases that are ridden with the terms I&#8217;ve grown so resentful of, do let me know in comments. I&#8217;ll help you get started with this one about Akamai and Delve Networks&#8217; recent forming of a <a href="http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=ind_focus.story&#038;STORY=/www/story/07-31-2009/0005069827&#038;EDATE=">strategic partnership</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Delve Networks, a <strong>leading</strong> provider of video platforms, announces a <strong>strategic relationship</strong> with Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKAM), the <strong>leader</strong> in powering rich media, dynamic transactions and enterprise applications online, that will enable Delve to offer customers a comprehensive and <strong>innovative</strong> video publishing solution that includes video management and delivery including support of <strong>next generation</strong> variable bit rate streaming technologies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we&#8217;ve been tracking the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/chrome-for-mac-starting-to-look-polished/">progress</a> of Google Chrome on the Mac for a while. The daily <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/">builds</a> of Chromium seem to be getting better and better, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/02/chrome-for-mac-coming-along-fine/">close</a> to being ready for prime time. One major thing missing however has been the lack of Adobe Flash support in the browser. Well, don&#8217;t look now, but it&#8217;s finally working — kind of.</p>
<p>Okay, to be honest, you can&#8217;t pause or stop Flash videos on sites like YouTube, but the important part is that when you click on a YouTube link, the videos actually play. That is great. I&#8217;m very, very close to using Chrome for the Mac on a daily basis already, and this may have just put me over the edge of at least using it as a secondary browser.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re getting very close to a release of Chrome for the Mac that is stable enough for regular web surfers to use. If the team has implemented Flash support, I have to believe that they are close to where they want to be in terms of a general release schedule. Of course, they have already released developer versions of the browser for the Mac, but they encouraged people <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/google-releases-dev-version-of-chrome-for-mac-and-linux-but-it-doesnt-want-you-to-use-it/">not to use them</a>. I think soon that mentality may change, and we may see a public beta.</p>

We&#8217;ve obtained copies of the letters and reprinted them below.</p>
<p>The newswire report notes that this is part of the FCC&#8217;s ongoing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/18/AR2009061803814.html">investigation</a> into wireless handsets and their exclusive deals with carriers.  Of course, this all comes <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">years</a> after Google CEO Eric Schmidt sent a letter to the FCC, urging it to adopt open standards that would gives users the freedom to use whichever applications they&#8217;d like on their wireless devices, on whichever network they preferred.  At the time the suggestions seemed perhaps a bit idealistic, but now it&#8217;s becoming clear just how badly they&#8217;re needed.</p>
<p>It has been just over one year since Apple released the App Store, and already we&#8217;re beginning to see just what can happen when major companies collude to restrict user choice without fear of recourse.  As I&#8217;ve written before, Google Voice offers a service that innovates in the telephony space in a way that hasn&#8217;t been seen for years.  But rather than try to improve and offer a better service, Apple and AT&#038;T are doing what they can do to protect their sacred cash cow.  But it looks like the government isn&#8217;t going to stand for that any longer.  With this move, the FCC is showing that it&#8217;s not going to let Apple carry its famed culture of secrecy into the telecom space.</p>

<p>RE: Google Voice and related iPhone applications</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Novelli:</p>
<p>Recent press reports indicate that Apple has declined to approve the Google Voice application for the iPhone and has removed related (and previously approved) third-party applications from the iPhone App Store.   In light of pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497), we are interested in a more complete understanding of this situation.</p>
<p>To that end, please provide answers to the following questions by close of business on Friday, August 21, 2009.</p>
<p>1.	Why did Apple reject the Google Voice application for iPhone and remove related third-party applications from its App Store?  In addition to Google Voice, which related third-party applications were removed or have been rejected?  Please provide the specific name of each application and the contact information for the developer.<br />
2.	Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&#038;T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications?  If the latter, please describe the communications between Apple and AT&#038;T in connection with the decision to reject Google Voice.  Are there any contractual conditions or non-contractual understandings with AT&#038;T that affected Apple’s decision in this matter?<br />
3.	Does AT&#038;T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)?  If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play?  What roles are specified in the contractual provisions between Apple and AT&#038;T (or any non-contractual understandings) regarding the consideration of particular iPhone applications?<br />
4.	Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone.  Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&#038;T’s 3G network?<br />
5.	What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons?  Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers?  If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers?<br />
6.	What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications?   What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)?  What is the percentage of applications that are rejected?  What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?</p>
<p>Request for Confidential Treatment.  If Apple requests that any information or documents responsive to this letter be treated in a confidential manner, it shall submit, along with all responsive information and documents, a statement in accordance with section 0.459 of the Commission&#8217;s rules.  47 C.F.R. § 0.459.  Requests for confidential treatment must comply with the requirements of section 0.459, including the standards of specificity mandated by section 0.459(b).  Accordingly, “blanket” requests for confidentiality of a large set of documents are unacceptable.  Pursuant to section 0.459(c), the Bureau will not consider requests that do not comply with the requirements of section 0.459.</p>

Last November a company called <a href="http://www.leader.com/">Leader Technologies</a>, which makes business communcation tools, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/11/19/patent-troll-lopes-after-facebook/">filed suit</a> against Facebook alleging that the social network had infringed on a patent that "relates to a method and system for the management and storage of electronic information."  The case is still ongoing, and it sounds like it has some legs — earlier this week Facebook was <a href="http://www.realgeek.com/facebook-ordered-to-give-leader-its-source-code/">ordered</a> by a Magistrate Judge from the District of Delaware's District Court to give Leader Technologies access to its entire source code.  As <a href="http://ip.law360.com/articles/113744">reported</a> at Law360, Facebook has until the end of this week to hand over a hierarchical map of the source, and has until August 21st to share its entire codebase with the company.

Of course, Facebook is going to fight tooth and nail against this, and is sure to appeal the ruling.  

Facebook has given us the following statement regarding the case:

<blockquote>While we respect the magistrate judge’s opinion, we disagree with it on this point and plan to appeal.  Generally, this suit is without merit and we will continue to fight it aggressively.

Image search is an area of intense competition between Google, Yahoo, and now Bing.  Today, <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> added some <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/search-options-now-on-google-images.html">search options</a> to make it easier to filter a search by color, type (face, photo, clip art, line drawing), and file size.  

Most of these filters were available before in advanced search, but now they are available in the left-hand column.  (A similar option column was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/google-launches-search-options-declares-real-time-search-biggest-challenge/">introduced</a> to the main search page in May, 2009).  You can choose more than one option to automatically narrow down your search.  Another option Google could add is sorting by images with a Creative Commons license.  It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/google-finally-adds-creative-commons-to-image-search/">already does this in its advanced search options</a>, but it is hidden there.  ]]></description>

<p>Image search is an area of intense competition between Google, Yahoo, and now Bing.  Today, <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> added some <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/search-options-now-on-google-images.html">search options</a> to make it easier to filter a search by color, type (face, photo, clip art, line drawing), and file size.  </p>
<p>Most of these filters were available before in advanced search, but now they are available in the left-hand column.  (A similar option column was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/12/google-launches-search-options-declares-real-time-search-biggest-challenge/">introduced</a> to the main search page in May, 2009).  You can choose more than one option to automatically narrow down your search.  Another option Google could add is sorting by images with a Creative Commons license.  It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/google-finally-adds-creative-commons-to-image-search/">already does this in its advanced search options</a>, but it is hidden there.  </p>
<p>Yahoo and Bing have similar filtering options, Although Google&#8217;s color filter is the most advanced. It allows you to sort by 12 different colors, wheras Bing and Yahoo only let you sort by color or black-and-white images.  Bing, however, does a better job with related searches, something Google is experimenting with in a slightly different way by actually trying to find <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/google-similar-images-first-look/" similar images.</a> And Yahoo has its </a><a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/sightsee-without-leaving-yahoo-image-search/">own set of novel features</a> in image search which Google doesn&#8217;t.  You can compare the three with a search for &#8220;fruit&#8221; on <a href="http://images.google.com/images?imgcolor=&#038;imgtbs=&#038;gbv=2&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=1&#038;q=fruit&#038;btnG=Search+images&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=&#038;aqi=&#038;start=0">Google Images</a>, <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0WTefOac3NKdvEArFyLuLkF?p=fruit&#038;ei=utf-8&#038;iscqry=&#038;fr=sfp">Yahoo Images</a>, and <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=fruit&#038;FORM=BIFD">Bing Images</a>.</p>

I remember where I was when it hit: On my way to Napa Valley with some friends as we heard sirens race by, likely signaling the end of the Twitter world as we knew it.</p>
<p>Okay, it didn&#8217;t end up being <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/12/twitpocalypse-not-now-crisis-averted/">that bad</a>. But it still was a pain in the ass for many third-party developers, especially the iPhone Twitter app developers, who had to wait in the App Store line like everyone else for their fixes to go through. And now it&#8217;s set to happen all over again!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/3059191420">A tweet</a> today from the TwitterAPI account warned that the second Twitpocalypse was closer than people thought. Okay, most people probably didn&#8217;t realize that it could occur again, but it can, and it will, and it&#8217;s fast approaching.</p>
<p>The <a href="Twitter status ids are fast approaching the maximum 32-bit *unsigned* ">current estimate</a> by the API team is that it will occur sometime in the next 60 days, probably at the end of September. They warn that it could happen sooner though.</p>
<p>So what does it mean, and why is it happening? Well, for those that don&#8217;t remember, the first Twitpocalypse occurred when the unique identifier for tweets hit 2,147,483,647 — the 32-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_%28computer_science%29">signed integer</a> limit. That number caused some third-party apps to start counting tweet identifiers as negative, screwing them up. This new Twitpocalpyse is similar, only it&#8217;s for the 32-bit <em>unsigned</em> integer value of 4,294,967,295.</p>
<p>In case you didn&#8217;t already realize it, the fact that this chasm between the two numbers was crossed so quickly once again shows that Twitter is growing very quickly. Though it&#8217;s not a 1 to 1 tweet-to-unique ID ratio, that the number will have doubled (an increase of over 2 billion) in just a few months is huge.</p>
<p>So what can you do to prepare yourself? Well the Twitter API team recommends developing your apps to use 64-bit integers, thus increasingly the number of tweets your app can recognize before it hits these integer walls.</p>
<p>Also, lock up the women and children.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the transcript:</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Microsoft and Yahoo! announced yesterday a partnership in the search and advertising business.  Under the deal, Yahoo!`s websites will be powered by Microsoft new search engine, Bing.  Yahoo! will get 88 percent of the ad revenue from searches on its sites for the first five years.  With the partnership, the two hope to take on Google, which currently commands about 65 percent share of the U.S. market.  The agreement follows Microsoft`s failed takeover bid for Yahoo! and shows the continuing importance it is placing on search.</p>
<p>Joining me now from Redmond, Washington, is Nick Wingfield of the &#8220;Wall Street Journal.&#8221;  Here in New York with me, Steven Levy of &#8220;Wired&#8221; magazine and Erick Schonfeld, co-editor of TechCrunch blog.  I am pleased to have all of them here.</p>
<p>Nick, tell me how this deal happened, first.</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  It started last year with the CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, making an unsolicited bid for close to $48 billion to acquire Yahoo!.  Never happened, Yahoo! resisted the offer.  It fell apart.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about January.  Yahoo! has a new CEO, Carol Bartz, and Microsoft and Yahoo! start talking about a more limited deal, not a full-blown acquisition, in which Microsoft basically take over the search operations, handle the search operations on Yahoo! in exchange for some value.  And the deal went through all sorts of fits and starts, and finally arrived at the deal you described a moment ago.</p>
<p>All of this being designed to improve Microsoft`s fairly poor position in search right now, which is a highly lucrative market, the online advertising market that accompanies search, and one that Microsoft really has not had much success in on its own.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is this a good deal for just Microsoft or good deal for Microsoft and Yahoo!?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, the shareholders of both companies seem to think it`s a better deal for Microsoft than it is for Yahoo!  The stock of Microsoft went up a bit yesterday and up a bit today.  Yahoo! is down.</p>
<p>One of the problems Yahoo! has is that they had sort of almost set expectation that they were going to get a big check, a multi-billion dollar check from Microsoft in exchange for a deal of this sort.  And that didn`t end up happening.  Instead, what Yahoo! is getting is very high percentage of the ad revenue from advertising sold on searches that Microsoft delivers.  So, both parties argue that it`s better for Yahoo! to get this, because they`re getting more &#8212; a bigger chunk of the share of ad revenue on an ongoing basis, but there is no big upfront check, and that seems to disappoint people.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  So, what`s the judgment of people who are looking at it in terms of whether Yahoo! would have been better to take the original deal that Ballmer offered or take the deal they have now?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, I don`t think there`s any question that Yahoo! shareholders would be better off if they had accepted the original $48 billion deal.  I don`t know what Yahoo!`s latest market capitalization is, but they`re down a lot.</p>
<p>So, I don`t think Microsoft, though, regrets not acquiring all of Yahoo!  I think they`re fairly happy with the position that they`re in.  They also have managed to improve their own home-grown search engine, which is now called Bing, and have started to inch up a little bit in market share.  So I think Microsoft probably comes out a little bit ahead here, but still, both parties argue that Yahoo! is going to thrive as well because they no longer have to invest in search, so they can be a lot more profitable.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Is this going to work?</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  It has a lot of hurdles.  I think the upfront money really isn`t the key to Yahoo!  The key is, Yahoo! is disbanding their search team, their engineering, and disbanding the team which built their advertising engine to sell ads on search.  Now, these happen to be some of the most important aspects of engineering at a company there.  And really, if Yahoo! wants to be a top Internet company, it has to have the engineering chops to keep doing that.</p>
<p>So, it`s going to miss out on that.  And it will save money by not hiring &#8212; having those people to pay, but those are the people you want in your company.</p>
<p>Also, this deal is a little complicated.  Yahoo! actually is going to sell some of these ads to the premium customers.  A lot of customers, those in the long tail, they just go on the website and buy the ads just straight there like you buy something from Amazon.  But a big customer needs someone to work with them and tell them what words to buy.  It`s very complicated in how much to bid, because these things are all done by bids.  And Yahoo! is doing that part, and Microsoft has the technology, which means those people who work for Yahoo! are really going to have to go back and forth to Redmond and talk to a lot of people to be familiar with how that works there.  So there`s a little complication in how they`re going to be able to do that, which is going to make it a little more difficult for Microsoft`s big task, which is to take on Google and build up its ad share to something beyond even what it has combined with Yahoo!</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Did Bing make a difference here at all, the fact that Bing has gotten &#8212; the Microsoft search engine has gotten good reviews?</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  I think Bing made a big difference, because Yahoo! was in a tough position.  It was seeing market share eroding from the top, from Google, and now the prospect of market share erosion from the bottom, from Bing.  Bing has only been out for two months, but it`s made a little bit of a gain in share, .4 percent.  Is that going to last over time? Who knows.  But Yahoo! didn`t want to find out.  Right?</p>
<p>And the big problem here is that Yahoo! really &#8212; they kind of walked away from the most interesting fight on the Internet right now, which is search.  And they handed it over to Microsoft for less than any of the previous deals that were on the table.  The four real deals that were on the table going back to the $45 or $48 billion offer in February of 2008, the revised search deal that Microsoft offered, which included $8 billion to buy 16 percent of Yahoo! and $1 billion payment for the search part of the business.  The Google deal that got squashed, that guaranteed $800 million in revenues.</p>
<p>This deal was the worst of all the deals.  And as Steve mentions, the deal introduces a lot of complexity, right?  So now you`re going to have Yahoo! sales people selling Microsoft`s search product.  So Yahoo! sales people already have enough problem talking to Yahoo! engineers.  Now they have to talk to Microsoft engineers.  And what if something goes wrong? Who are they going to yell at?  Are the Microsoft engineers going to like that, being yelled at by Yahoo! sales people?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Nick, you`re in Redmond.  What does this do for Steve Ballmer?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, it gives him a real fighting chance in a market that he said is strategic to the company.  They have about 8.4 percent market share on their own with Bing.  With Yahoo!`s market share, they could go to 30 percent of shares &#8212; 30 percent of searches in the U.S., and that`s significant.</p>
<p>Now the question is, does it decline from there? Can they increase it?  If they do that, you know, how much money do they make off of it?  Because of course, Microsoft is losing money in its Internet search business right now.  But they just want to gain the share.  They argue once they gain the share, they get eyeballs.  Search is a scale business, that they will start to improve the quality of the search, because they can do all sorts of things, make ads more relevant.  And if they do that, they think they can have a flywheel effect and start really eating into Google`s share.</p>
<p>The other thing that this lets them do is, Google is not only strong in search with 65 percent plus share, but Google is also moving into these other areas that are quite threatening to Microsoft.  They`re using their profits in search to get into operating systems, into online applications that are free, that threaten these cash-cow businesses like Office and Word and Excel.  And they just recently announced that they`re going to be doing an operating system for laptops.  They already have one for mobile phones.  And I think Microsoft wants to gain share in search in part to help alleviate that threat.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  And what about the leadership of Yahoo!?  Carol Bartz?</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  Well, she felt she had to do something.  But I think in this case, by targeting the search team and taking it away, some people wonder whether that`s going to really take the glue, which keeps her portal together there.</p>
<p>The search that Yahoo! did had, you know, about three times the size of what Microsoft search, mainly because so many people come to Yahoo! and they search there.  So it really was an opportunity for Yahoo! to grow out there and do more.</p>
<p>She says this is going to enable them to concentrate on the other things that they do.  But having a very strong search team and engineering that comes with that search, and with the really complicated engineering you have to do to be able to sell ads on searches, that`s very complex.  And you know, for reasons we can get into, it really helps if your share grows.  Not having that, those engineers aren`t going to be able to filter through the rest of the company to help you do these other things there.  If you look at the team now, gee, what are they going to do?  It`s going to take well over a year for this to come to fruition with this deal there.  So if I`m working as an engineer for Yahoo! now, what`s my future?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  That`s &#8212; and losing talent is the big issue so much, because they`re creating the new software and building on the old.</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  And who is one of the most talented people at Microsoft, the one they all talk about there, is Qi Lu, the guy who came from Yahoo!, and went to Microsoft.  He`s now the big technology leader, the bright guy who is leading Microsoft search.</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  All right.  What about AOL? What`s going to happen to AOL?</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  So, I think AOL is a great example here, because you`ve got Tim Armstrong, who came from Google, who is now the new CEO of AOL, and he took what was really a hobbled company, and is taking it in a new direction, away from the sweet spot that Google or Yahoo! or Microsoft already dominate in.  He`s hiring hundreds of journalists, which as you know from your Politico piece, that you know, they are very, very valuable assets.  And is kind of creating &#8212; that`s just one part of his business &#8212; is creating this sort of new newsstand online.  And is doing a lot of interesting things.</p>
<p>And so why didn`t Carol Bartz do that?  Why didn`t she double down?  You can make the argument that you know, ultimately she had to do something, because she doesn`t have Microsoft`s Windows money and she doesn`t have Google`s search money.  So ultimately search is an expensive game and maybe she has to get out of that business, ultimately.</p>
<p>But Microsoft needs her search volume.  Why not double down, invest in search, and get a better deal down the line?  Or merge with AOL when they become public?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Speaking of one final issue, anti-trust, Nick.  Is Google worried about anti-trust ramifications of its market share?  Will this deal be subject to anti-trust implications, questions?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, Google is I think worried, yes, about their future in anti-trust.  In this particular case of Microsoft and Yahoo!, they argue that together they have 30 percent of the market, compared to Google`s 65 percent.  And so they think they are going to have a pretty strong case with the anti-trust regulators.  They are definitely going to face some tough scrutiny.  They`re prepared, I think, to really fight with Google, but it`s unclear what Google is going to do.  There was some talk today at this Microsoft meeting I was at of Google employing sort of third-party advocacy groups to fight the deal.  But Google really is the big gorilla here.  So it`s a little challenging for them to make an argument that this is going to be anti-competitive.  Google has…</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p>STEVEN LEVY:  There`s a really delicious irony here, because last year, when there was the threat of Microsoft buying Yahoo!, Google wanted to make a deal with Yahoo! for the search.  It was not on the scale of this, and Microsoft complained about it, and said to the Justice Department, successfully argued that, hey, we can`t do this, because Yahoo! would end its search team.  There would be less competition in there.  Guess what?</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  They`ll take over their search team.  Yes.</p>
<p>Is there a feeling with the search &#8212; Bing getting good marks and now this deal, that Microsoft is back and that Microsoft can deliver a lot more than people, or may be much stronger than people assumed it was, say six months ago, when the effort to buy Yahoo! came to nothing?</p>
<p>NICK WINGFIELD:  Well, there definitely is a feeling that they are on an upswing in terms of the quality of their products.  Windows 7 is coming out, which they hope will erase the sort of disdain of Windows Vista, which was a very troubled operating system for them with some technical problems.  Bing is doing well.  They have done some innovative stuff in games.  But they`ve also got some real challenges.  For example, some people think that they have placed too much emphasis on search and neglected mobile phones.  They have a pretty poor offering there.  And Apple`s got the iPhone and others are doing very well in that category.  So they`ve got some big challenges in other areas as well.</p>
<p>ERICK SCHONFELD:  Microsoft no doubt is better off today in search than it was before.  But we shouldn`t overestimate what their advantage is.  Even if they have 30 percent of the search market share, they don`t have 30 percent of the revenues, because they`re giving 88 percent of that back to Yahoo!</p>
<p>CHARLIE ROSE:  Exactly.  Nick Wingfield, &#8220;Wall Street Journal&#8221; here.  Erick Schonfeld from TechCrunch and Steve Levy from &#8220;Wired,&#8221; thank you all.</p>

Which countries are the worst greenhouse gas emitters?  Now you can see for yourself on this <a href="http://maps.unfccc.int/di/map/">handy Google Map</a> created by a department of the UN and Google.  The map shows changes in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2006.  Green is good (a decrease in emissions) and purple is bad (an increase).

So who are the worst offenders?  Topping the list is Sweden!  The country has managed to increase its emissions by 110 percent over that time period.  So much for Nordic purity.  Following Sweden is Turkey (with a 103 percent increase) and Canada (with a 55 percent increase).  Yes, Canada.  What is it with these northern countries?]]></description>

<p>You&#8217;d think the U.S. would top the list, but it is actually only the tenth worst country with a 14 percent increase in emissions (still well within purple territory).  It is kind of embarrassing that Russia is greener than we are.  But at least we are better than Canada (and Sweden).</p>
<p>Or are we?  The map itself lets you drill down into the data to find out.  You can sort by industry, type of emission (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc), or year, and if click on a country it gives you a detailed breakdown of emissions by economic sector and other variables.  For instance, over the 1990 to 2006 time span, Russia has actually seen a 29 percent decrease in emissions, but if you look at <a href="http://maps.unfccc.int/di/map/?year=2006&#038;gas=Aggregate_GHGs&#038;sector=to">just 2006</a>, Russia starts getting pretty purple, and rises to the No. 3 worst emitter.  And the USA rises to No. 1.  </p>
<p>Hey, we&#8217;re No. 1!</p>

<strong>Background Info:</strong> The Twin Cities denotes the capital city of St. Paul, MN and the larger, more cosmopolitan city of Minneapolis, MN. Together the two cities are home to roughly 2.5 million people.

There's always been a friendly little rivalry going on between the two cities, with some people from Minneapolis viewing people from St. Paul as more blue-collar and rough-around-the-edges, while some from St. Paul think people from Minneapolis are yuppies. I've lived in both cities and they're both nice places. Overall, the rivalry is pretty silly, but it's there. Look hard enough in any city, though, and you'll find both a-holes and nice people. No different in the Twin Cities. Everyone's pretty nice, overall, though.]]></description>

The recession in online advertising, which began in the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/01/the-online-ad-recession-is-officially-here-first-quarterly-decline-in-revenues/">first quarter of 2009</a>, continued into the second. Every quarter we keep track of the combined advertising revenues of the four largest Web advertising companies (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/17/how-google-made-its-q2-numbers-squeezing-expenses/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/yahoos-revenues-drop-13-percent-in-second-quarter-announces-5-percent-of-employees-to-lose-jobs/">Yahoo</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/microsofts-money-pit-every-dollar-of-online-revenue-is-wiped-out-by-a-dollar-of-loss/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/the-hangover-time-warners-q2-results-feature-a-lot-of-goodbye-aol-talk/">AOL</a>), which together represent the lion's share of all online advertising revenues and is a decent proxy for the market as a whole.  In the second quarter of 2009, their combined global ad revenues were $7.864 billion, down 3.4 percent from a year ago.

In economics, a general rule of thumb is that two down quarters marks a recession.  Last quarter saw the first annual decline in advertising revenues of 2.1 percent. And the annual decline this quarter got a little worse.  However, on a sequential basis compared to last quarter, it is actually pretty much flat (but still down 0.18 percent).  So we now have two down quarters on both an annual and sequential basis.  

Will this recession continue into the current quarter, or did we just witness a fundamental <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/24/microsoft-steve-ballmer-cannes">"reset"</a>, as Steve Ballmer likes to call it. ]]></description>

<p>The recession in online advertising, which began in the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/01/the-online-ad-recession-is-officially-here-first-quarterly-decline-in-revenues/">first quarter of 2009</a>, continued into the second.

<p>In economics, a general rule of thumb is that two down quarters marks a recession.  Last quarter saw the first annual decline in advertising revenues of 2.1 percent. And the annual decline this quarter got a little worse.  However, on a sequential basis compared to last quarter, it is actually pretty much flat (but still down 0.18 percent).  So we now have two down quarters on both an annual and sequential basis.  </p>
<p>Will this recession continue into the current quarter, or did we just witness a fundamental <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/24/microsoft-steve-ballmer-cannes">&#8220;reset&#8221;</a>, as Steve Ballmer likes to call it.  What that implies is that advertising revenues have been reset to a lower level from which they can once again grow.  We&#8217;ll see what happens in the third quarter, but anecdotally I am hearing from advertising startups that the worst is behind us.  </p>
<p>This may be wishful thinking, of course.  But barring any new economic catastrophe, the advertising levels of the past two quarters seems like the new floor.  But how long will it take to get up off that floor?</p>
<p>These numbers represent global advertising revenues, and include network revenues paid to affiliates through AdSense and Yahoo’s ad network.  Google’s licensing revenues for Google Enterprise Apps have been stripped out.  For the other companies, we include only the advertising portions of their online revenues as reported in their quarterly earnings statements.</p>

Unfortunately, that's not quite ready yet. But in the meantime, they have another iPhone app that is ready, and it's about as simple as can be — which may be good thing.

Called 12cast, the app claims to be the "simplest way to get video on Twitter." Here's how it works, you open the app, enter a title for the video, then rotate it to the left to bring up the video camera. You then record footage, hit send, and you're done. (If you're not logged into Twitter, there will be a prompt that comes up to allow you to do that.)]]></description>

Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not quite ready yet. But in the meantime, they have another iPhone app that is ready, and it&#8217;s about as simple as can be — which may be good thing.</p>
<p>Called 12cast, the app claims to be the &#8220;simplest way to get video on Twitter.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how it works, you open the app, enter a title for the video, then rotate it to the left to bring up the video camera. You then record footage, hit send, and you&#8217;re done. (If you&#8217;re not logged into Twitter, there will be a prompt that comes up to allow you to do that.)</p>
<p>If the video you shot was over 12 seconds, it will only take the first 12 seconds. And because of the 12seconds limit, the uploading of the video occurs very quickly. And you can also use footage you&#8217;ve already shot and saved, by clicking the &#8220;library&#8221; link on the title page. Again, the 12 second rule will be in place.</p>
<p>As with the larger 12seconds app they&#8217;re working on, 12cast is all about using the video service on top of the Twitter social graph. The goal here was to build an app with the lowest barrier way to put video onto Twitter. The plan for a future update is to include Facebook Connect as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, this app will only work with the new iPhone 3GS, which has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/20/it-really-should-have-been-called-the-iphone-3g-v-%E2%80%94-for-video/">video capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>The app will be available for free in the App Store at some point later today.<em> (Update: The app is now live, <a href="http://www.12seconds.tv/12cast">here</a>.)</em></p>

The homepage features a quick poll asking members if they want to see Times’ reporters and editors on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or not.  I guess this is the most pressing issue the New York Times wants to hear from its readers about.

<p>Apparently, the New York Times is still unsure whether its reporters should be allowed to Tweet or not.  Intrigued by <a href="http://twitter.com/stoweboyd/status/2950495721">this tweet</a> from writer and consultant <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/">Stowe Boyd</a>, I registered for the New York Times&#8217; <a href="https://www.nytinsightlab.com">Insight Lab</a>, an online community / focus group made up of Times readers interested in providing the media company with direct feedback.</p>
<p>The homepage features a quick poll asking members if they want to see Times’ reporters and editors on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or not.  I guess this is the most pressing issue the New York Times wants to hear from its readers about.</p>
<p>For some reason, close to three quarters of the respondents indicated that they&#8217;d prefer if the journalists stay far away from the micro-sharing service.  Only 7 percent had no idea what Twitter is.  There is zero indication on the site how many people are actually registered members of the Insight Lab, let alone how many so far participated in this poll. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m surprised to see the negative answer leading at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> the NYT tells me The lab launched three weeks ago and currently has approximately 3,000 members, of which 455 members had responded to the Twitter poll at the time they contacted me.  The media company emphasized that it has a robust and growing presence on social media sites like Twitter (more than 1.5 million followers to @nytimes and many individual journalists, with large Twitter followings).</p>
<p>In my mind, journalists are free to join any social networking site they want as long as they conduct themselves online the way they&#8217;re supposed to behave in meat space e.g. not embarrass themselves or the publications they work for and never do or say anything that could call their professional reputation into question. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=157136">their policy</a> on those sorts of things (a <a href="http://savethemedia.com/2009/05/14/more-on-newspapers-use-of-social-media/">wee bit paranoid</a> indeed, but understandable).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of asking readers if Times journalists should be on Twitter, come to think of it?   Maybe the Times is just looking for guidance, but something tells me they&#8217;d get better answers if they asked this question on Twitter itself. The <a href="http://twitter.com/NyTimes">@NYTimes </a>  account has 1.5 million followers, which is probably a much bigger sample than the people who managed to find the poll hidden away on the Insight Lab site.  </p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s far from perfect, but it&#8217;s not a fad. In my experience, you can get a lot of value out of the service as a reporter even if you choose not to engage in public tweeting but rather keep to a close circle. Heck, even Twitter Search seems to me an essential tool for journalists tracking breaking stories and events. Why would readers want journalists to be <em>less</em> informed?</p>
<p>Help the New York Times by answering our our own poll:</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bongobing-215x79.png" width="215" height="79" />The Laptop Company, operator of a web-based shopping platform through its <a href="http://www.BongoBing.com">BongoBing</a> website, has filed a request for an extension of time to oppose Microsoft in its efforts to register a trademark for the name <a href="http://bing.com">“Bing”</a> with the USPTO. Furthermore, The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has effectively granted the extension request until October 28, 2009.

Here's what BongoBing CEO and co-founder Raul Pellerano had to say about it: 



<blockquote>“We have worked hard and invested significant resources in building our BongoBingTM brand and identity, our website and services, and our corporate identity. We believe it is important for a small company like The Laptop Company to continue to use its trademarks and conduct business without confusion in the marketplace.”</blockquote>]]></description>

<p>I have a <a href="http://twitter.com/BongoBing/status/2944855183">sneaking suspicion</a> that The Laptop Company is doing this because of the almost guaranteed press attention this will be getting, in which case its strategy has already paid off. </p>
<p>Hands up if you think they actually have a case.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/unlock.gif" class="shot2" />I expect many of you already were aware of this, but I can imagine at least some of you aren&#8217;t yet, so here goes: apparently you can lift the usage restrictions from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">Adobe PDF</a> files by simply forwarding them as attachments to your <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> account and <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=30719&#038;hl=en">opening them in HTML mode</a> right from your inbox. That way, you can copy whatever the &#8217;secured&#8217; PDF contains to a text editing program and do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>For your reference: PDFs (Portable Document Format) can be encrypted so that a password is needed to view or edit its content, and they can also contain embedded DRM restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing.</p>
<p>Turns out the &#8220;View in HTML&#8221; feature in Gmail can display an HTML version of the encrypted file, stripping out the restrictions. Part of the layout might be lost in the process, but the text can easily be extracted with a simple copy/paste command. In case the original PDF file had printing restrictions, those are stripped as well.</p>
<p>I searched a bit for similar reports and found <a href="http://chosaq.net/archives/2006/04/circumvent-pdf-drm-with-gmail.html">this article</a>, dated April 2006, which was one of the first to discover the trick. The same blog later <a href="http://chosaq.net/archives/2006/05/gmail-cripples-drmed-pdf-files-view-as-html-functionality.html">updated readers</a> on the situation, stating Google crippled the security circumvention so that DRMed PDF files could no longer be opened in HTML mode, but a quick test with a secured file just worked fine right here and now. (<strong>Update:</strong> apparently, it doesn&#8217;t <em>always</em> work)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but this&#8217;ll save me some trouble next time someone sends me an encrypted Adobe PDF file that I&#8217;d like to copy or edit. Unless it&#8217;s illegal, in which case this post doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

After his arrest, and without a lawyer present, McKinnon admitted to hacking, but denies it was malicious or that he caused damage costing $800,000 (£487,000). The argument of his lawyers was not that he shouldn't be tried, but that he should be tried in the UK and that his extreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>, an autism spectrum disorder, should be taken into account, especially since it could lead to suicide, if he was to be extradited.

He faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted in the U.S. of what prosecutors have called "the biggest military computer hack of all time". He accessed 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa.

Now, exactly what was this hack? McKinnon has always insisted he was looking for classified documents on UFOs which he believed the US authorities had suppressed. This is not a normal guy here. This is a mega geek who believed in UFOs. We're not talking terrorist material. He's been described as a 43-year-old "UFO eccentric". 

In fact McKinnon's case reminds me very much of the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Forbes Nash, Jr.</a>, the subject of the 2001 movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/">A Beautiful Mind</a>. Nash was a mathematical genius who suffered from extreme paranoia - but his work on game theory ended up contributing to U.S. strategy during the Cold War.

Should Gary McKinnon therefore be left to rot in a U.S. jail for the rest of his life? Or should his skills be put to better use?]]></description>

This is not an easy decision.

I was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/">there</a> in January 2007 when it was announced and I bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone">first iPhone</a> as soon as it was available. I happily bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3g">iPhone 3G</a> a year later. I've proudly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">yelled</a> <em>"I Am A Member Of The Cult Of iPhone."</em> I've been an unabashed cheerleader for the device <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/mossberg-levy-and-arrington-talk-iphone-yahoo-on-charlie-rose/">to all who'll listen</a>. And I've <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/14/of-course-youll-keep-developing-for-the-iphone/">scoffed</a> at developers who said they'd abandon the platform.

But I'm not going to upgrade to the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3gs">iPhone 3GS</a>. Instead, I'm abandoning the iPhone and AT&#038;T. I will grudgingly pay the $175 AT&#038;T termination fee and then I will move on to another device.

What finally put me over the edge? ]]></description>

I&#8217;ve proudly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">yelled</a> <em>&#8220;I Am A Member Of The Cult Of iPhone.&#8221;</em> I&#8217;ve been an unabashed cheerleader for the device <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/mossberg-levy-and-arrington-talk-iphone-yahoo-on-charlie-rose/">to all who&#8217;ll listen</a>.

<p>But I&#8217;m not going to upgrade to the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3gs">iPhone 3GS</a>. Instead, I&#8217;m abandoning the iPhone and AT&#038;T. I will grudgingly pay the $175 AT&#038;T termination fee and then I will move on to another device.</p>
<p>What finally put me over the edge? It wasn&#8217;t the routinely dropped calls, something you can only truly understand once you have owned an iPhone (and which <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/02/11/my-big-iphone-break-up/">drove</a> my friend Om Malik to bail). I&#8217;ve lived with that for two years. It&#8217;s not the lack of AT&#038;T coverage at home. I&#8217;ve lived with that for two years, too. It certainly isn&#8217;t the lack of a physical keyboard, that has never bothered me. No, what finally put me over the edge is the Google Voice debacle. </p>
<p>Most of you won&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, so I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>Google Voice is a call management service that lets you determine what calls get through to you based on who&#8217;s calling and what time of day it is, among other factors. It has amazing features, like automatically transcribing all your voicemails. And you can forward calls to any other phone easily and automatically. Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/11/grand-central-to-finally-launch-as-google-voice-its-very-very-good/">overview of the service</a> if you aren&#8217;t familiar with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to use Google Voice but there&#8217;s a big switching cost - changing your phone number. Too many people have that phone number and use it to call in great stories. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m giving that up. And there&#8217;s another problem with Google Voice. When you make outbound calls from a phone, it (obviously) doesn&#8217;t use your Google Voice phone number, so recipients don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s you calling. Those were two hurdles I wasn&#8217;t willing to jump over.</p>
<p>But now Google is planning on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/google-voices-secret-weapon-number-portability/">rolling out number portability</a>, so I can move my mobile phone number to Google. None of my friends, family or contacts have to store a new number.</p>
<p>That still leaves the problem of outbound calls, though. I can move my mobile number to Google and then get a new iPhone account, but outbound calls won&#8217;t be identified because they are on the new number. Google has a solution for that too, though. They are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">releasing apps for a variety of handsets</a> that effectively take over the native dialer, address book and call log. Problem solved. I can use any phone I like, or a bunch of phones, and just choose the one that makes sense at any time. I never have to be tied to a carrier and their restrictive contracts again.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. Apple and AT&#038;T are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">now blocking</a> the iPhone version of the Google Voice app. Why? Because they absolutely don&#8217;t want people doing exactly what I&#8217;m doing - moving their phone number to Google and using the carrier as a dumb pipe.</p>
<p>So I have to choose between the iPhone and Google Voice. It&#8217;s not an easy decision. Except, it sort of is. Google isn&#8217;t forcing the decision on me, Apple and AT&#038;T are. So I choose to work with the company that isn&#8217;t forcing me to do things their way. And in this case, that&#8217;s Google.</p>
<p>So what phone will I use next? Well, that decision is easy, too. I&#8217;d move to the <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/06/22/review-palm-pre/">Palm Pre</a> because I believe it is the best phone out there other than the iPhone 3GS. But Google hasn&#8217;t created an app for the Palm Pre yet, just Android and Blackberry phones. So for now I&#8217;m going to use the new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/21/t-mobile-will-drop-its-second-android-phone-the-mytouch-3g-this-august-for-199/">Android myTouch 3G</a> along with the Google Voice App. As soon as something better comes out, or Google makes an app for the Pre, I&#8217;ll switch. And keep the same phone number. No long term contracts for me.</p>
<p>And Apple, if you ever decide to put the hammer down on AT&#038;T and do the right thing for your loyal users, I&#8217;ll consider switching back. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll just use one of many iPod Touches laying around our office to test out new apps.</p>

<p>eBay is developing new peer-to-peer software to run the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/skype">Skype service</a>, they revealed in a quarterly SEC statement. </p>
<p>The existing peer-to-peer software is controlled by <a href="http://www.joltid.com/">Joltid</a>, a company controlled by Skype&#8217;s founders Zennstrom and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/janus-friis">Janus Friis</a>.

<p>eBay is developing the new software in the event they lose the right to continue to license that technology, but warns that <em>&#8220;such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>This comes as eBay prepares to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/breaking-ebay-announces-plans-to-sell-skype/">spin off Skype</a> as in independent public company. And the service is surging in popularity, with 480 million registered users and $170 million in quarterly revenue.</p>
<p>The case isn&#8217;t scheduled for trial until June 2010. Don&#8217;t expect an IPO before that, unless a settlement is reached quickly.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000119312509157212/d10q.htm">10Q</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Skype licenses peer-to-peer communication technology from Joltid Limited pursuant to a license agreement between the parties. The parties had been discussing a dispute over the license. In March 2009, Skype Technologies S.A. filed a claim in the English High Court of Justice (No. HC09C00756) against Joltid Limited. Following the filing of the claim, Joltid purported to terminate the license agreement between the parties. In particular, Joltid has alleged that Skype should not possess, use or modify certain software source code and that, by doing so, and by disclosing such code in certain U.S. patent cases pursuant to orders from U.S. courts, Skype has breached the license agreement. Joltid has brought a counterclaim alleging that Skype has repudiated the license agreement, infringed Joltid’s copyright and misused confidential information. On the basis of, among other things, the parties’ mutual dealings since the execution of the license agreement, Skype asked the English High Court for declaratory relief, including findings that Skype is not in breach of the license agreement, that Joltid’s notice of breach and subsequent notice of termination are invalid, and that Joltid has certain indemnity obligations in relation to the U.S. patent proceedings. Trial is currently scheduled for June 2010. Although Skype is confident of its legal position, as with any litigation, there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation. Skype has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through Joltid. However, such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive. If Skype was to lose the right to use the Joltid software as the result of the litigation, and if alternative software was not available, Skype would be severely and adversely affected and the continued operation of Skype’s business as currently conducted would likely not be possible. </p></blockquote>

Developers put their heart and soul into building an application for the iPhone App Store only to have it rejected by Apple. And sometimes apps are at first accepted and then later pulled for odd reasons. And sometimes app updates are rejected, even though there isn&#8217;t much difference with the version accepted. We get a half dozen or so stories sent to us now <em>every single day</em>. It&#8217;s no wonder that a lot of mobile developers are growing wary of the App Store. But Steven Frank is not one of those developers.</p>
<p>Steven Frank doesn&#8217;t make iPhone apps, specifically for the reasons stated above. But he is a very popular Mac developer, that co-founded the OS X development house <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>, makers of the popular coding application <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, among other apps. Frank is well-known in some circles as a Mac enthusiast. You know, the kind of person that is often derided as a &#8220;fanboy.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why what I&#8217;m about to tell you is surprising: He&#8217;s ditching his iPhone.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/152606616/im-furious-with-apple-and-at-t-right-now-with">a candid post</a> today, Frank explains his utter frustration with both Apple and AT&amp;T over the way they&#8217;ve handled the device and its developers. The whole Google Voice <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">fiasco</a> was the last straw for him. Again, Frank doesn&#8217;t make iPhone apps, but he&#8217;s simply disgusted as an end-user — someone who pays close to or over $100 a month, and can&#8217;t use a range of apps that are available on other phones, including some also on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>And so he&#8217;s now ditching his iPhone and boycotting any device that runs the iPhone OS (including, if applicable, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/report-the-large-form-ipod-touch-apples-tablet-on-track-for-early-2010/">rumored Mac tablet</a>). He says he&#8217;s going to get a Palm Pre, a device he considers inferior to the iPhone, but one that doesn&#8217;t (at least so far) have the app issues the iPhone does. (Nor does it have the AT&amp;T issues.)</p>
<p>Is Frank crazy? If he is, he&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Perhaps you heard about Om Malik of GigaOM <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/02/11/my-big-iphone-break-up/">doing the same thing</a> over frustrations with AT&amp;T several months ago. And as someone who covers the iPhone ecosystem quite a bit, I&#8217;ve had a number of discussions with iPhone users who have either ditched their device over similar concerns, or are considering it.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not there yet. I still consider the iPhone to be too far ahead of the other smartphones even with its (sometimes major) flaws in the App Store. But I&#8217;m getting much closer than I ever imagined to looking at other phones simply because of my <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">complete and utter disliking of AT&amp;T</a> at this point. At the very least, if Apple doesn&#8217;t get rid of the AT&amp;T exclusivity agreement next year (which, for the record, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">I think it will</a>), I&#8217;m going to unlock my iPhone to use it on another network.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a separate issue from Frank&#8217;s. He&#8217;s right about Apple&#8217;s often odd, and sometimes downright hostile actions towards developers in regards to the iPhone. It needs a better set of guidelines for developers to work with, because clearly, the current ones aren&#8217;t cutting it. And it needs to be more consistant with adhering to its guidelines. I&#8217;d also say that some more transparency would be nice, but I know that will fall upon deaf ears. This is Apple, after all.</p>
<p>The iPhone and the App Store remain too far ahead of the competition for one person, no matter how big, or even a group of people leaving, to have much of an impact. But Apple has to be careful that its rivals don&#8217;t mature quicker than anticipated (the Pre finally opened its webOS SDK, for example), or we could see some serious defections. By that I mean at first some developers, fed up with the App Store, may move on to other platforms. And that may lead to more doing then same. Eventually, that will trickle down to the end-users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that will happen, but there is a lot of outcry for changes right now. And it&#8217;s getting louder everyday.</p>

Consumer startups are tough. You have two basic choices: A paid offering or a free offering (or freemium). If you charge people a penny, you’ll turn off the bulk of your visitors. If you offer free services, you might grow to be the next YouTube, Wordpress or Facebook. Most entrepreneurs are not risk-averse and the dream of being big is just too appealing and the majority of us take the “free-route”.

Once you offer something for free, all shades of people will try to benefit from your service. You’d think a service like Sampa with a strong family and baby branding would just repel small business, teenagers, criminals, etc. but that’s not the case at all. And I suspect most blogging services; photo-sharing or web-site building solutions face the exact same issue we did.

<p>Once you offer something for free, all shades of people will try to benefit from your service. You’d think a service like Sampa with a strong family and baby branding would just repel small business, teenagers, criminals, etc. but that’s not the case at all. And I suspect most blogging services; photo-sharing or web-site building solutions face the exact same issue we did.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs and investors will look at data analysis and talk about averages or totals: Averages number of blog posts per user per week, average number of sign-ins per user per month, viral coefficient, total number of active users, etc. Entrepreneurs who are more sophisticated will split their “averages” and “totals” in two or three groups. For example, fixing one of the dimensions into users that sign-in 30 or more times per month (very engaged), between 10 and 29 times per month (engaged), and between 0-9 times per month (on the brink of leaving) and then run the averages and totals for the different groups (e.g. &#8220;very engaged users upload 25 pictures/month, engaged users upload 7 pictures/month, etc.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Very few startups actually look at demographic and psychographic data as a way to group their users. Primarily, because it’s hard to get gender, age, income, interests and intentions without asking the user, and once you ask them you might just scare them way or get the wrong information.</p>
<p>One time we went to pitch Sampa to a VC in Seattle, and out of the blue he mentions this other startup growing amazingly fast – had nothing to do with our business. After the meeting I went to check the startup website. Their Compete and Alexa growth was just amazing. Their website contained profiles of all users since it was a public social network. So I clicked on the profile of the 20 people featured on their homepage (“most recent users to join”). Of those, about 75% were girls between the age of 9 and 13 – likely the worst demographic to make any revenue from.</p>
<p>Did the startup know about this? Oh, yeah. Did that VC that was looking at investing on them? Likely not.</p>
<p>In the middle of 2008 we decide to do a qualitative analysis of our user base. People of all kinds were creating sites on Sampa. There wasn’t an automated way to know if it was a baby site, a family site, a small business, a technology blog, etc. We looked at more than 300 sites, randomly selected and created a spreadsheet with the category, the demographic of the author (if we could figure out) and we plugged that into our own analytic system to split our averages and totals for each site category. The results sucked!</p>
<p>Just 20% of our users were on the target audience. That meant 80% were not building any kind of family or baby site. Ok, maybe we can live with that. But it turned out that more than 25% were by pre-teens. There are two problems with that: First, It’s actually illegal in the US and most countries to allow a younger than 13-year-old to sign up to your service without parental consent. Second, pre-teens are not a great audience to build an advertising-based business model.</p>
<p>However the data showed an even worse picture. Pre-teens were a quick burning flame. They would come, upload lots of pictures, write lots of blog posts, “bling” their site, invite 20+ friends and they would be completely gone in a month. That behavior skewed our data enough that once we looked at our growth, viral rates, and everything else, our business didn’t look so great.</p>
<p>Being Proactive Can Backfire</p>
<p>Can you force users to comply with your Terms-Of-Service and still be successful on a UGC service? Yes, you can. Facebook manage to be very aggressive on the enforcement of their TOS, and so did Flickr. However, if you look at most Web 2.0 startups, they are not doing that at all. The most prominent case is YouTube, which allowed copyright infringement on their website and can plot a $1.6B exit based on their “turn a blind eye” strategy.</p>
<p>We didn’t do that at Sampa, and I’m sure we could have seen 2 or 3 times more growth if we had used the same strategy. We proactively removed pre-teens websites. They weren’t easy to find, but every time we found one, we would remove the website and notify the owner she was 12-years-old. They would be mad at us and tell that “Jamie, Emily and Sally also have a website on Sampa”, and we would say thank you and delete all their friends websites too.</p>
<p>We would also proactively delete porn websites. There is nothing wrong with porn. It’s not illegal or immoral in my view, but it didn’t go well with our family-oriented business proposition. Also, most UGC porn sites are infringing in someone else copyright and we just didn’t want to deal with DMCA or lawyers.</p>
<p>We also found criminal websites, from people trying to steal credit-card and passwords to the ugly side of online pedophilia. We had the FBI come over twice to collect evidence.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget link-farms. Although we had CAPTCHA and email confirmation for new websites, every once in a while someone managed to create dozens of websites in a single day all full of links to some bank, real estate agent, mortgage broker, auto dealer, etc. I’m sure the business that were benefiting from it didn’t know they hired a “black-hat” SEO.</p>
<p>Pretty much every Social Network-builder, website builder or content sharing site deals with the same issues we dealt with. A good number of entrepreneurs (and most investors) will be oblivious to those facts and just think that everything is going great and the growth is sustainable and proof they are creating great value and soon will be able to turn a huge profit or to sell for hundreds of millions of dollars, until someone takes the time to figure out what people are using their service for and finds out it’s really not what they thought it was.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/myspaceilike-215x140.jpg" width="215" height="140" />As more details emerge about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/17/breaking-myspace-close-to-acquiring-ilike/">MySpace-iLike acquisition</a>, all sorts of interesting observations and questions pop up. A few thoughts:

<em>The Facebook Angle</em>

This is by far the most interesting angle to the deal. iLike is the most popular music application on Facebook, and is the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/23/facebook-dreams-of-easy-music-while-religious-battle-rages-internally/">de facto Facebook Music app</a>. That company will shortly be owned by MySpace, Facebook's primary competitor. That puts Facebook in a lose-lose situation. They can let iLike continue to dominate the music scene on Facebook and let MySpace own all that. Or they can ban iLike and lose all credibility with their platform - everyone would know iLike was banned because of the acquisition by MySpace. And it doesn't have to be an outright ban. Facebook has plenty of subtle ways of trainwrecking an application they don't like. Keep an eye on this.

Why didn't Facebook just buy iLike? A matching or slightly better offer than the $20 million MySpace is paying would likely have gotten the deal done. And it may have saved Facebook from an embarrassing situation.

If I were MySpace, I'd focus on getting their free streaming music into the iLike Facebook application as soon as possible. Advertisers will love it.

A few thoughts:</p>
<p><em>The Facebook Angle</em></p>
<p>This is by far the most interesting angle to the deal. iLike is the most popular music application on Facebook, and is the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/23/facebook-dreams-of-easy-music-while-religious-battle-rages-internally/">de facto Facebook Music app</a>. That company will shortly be owned by MySpace, Facebook&#8217;s primary competitor. That puts Facebook in a lose-lose situation. They can let iLike continue to dominate the music scene on Facebook and let MySpace own all that. Or they can ban iLike and lose all credibility with their platform - everyone would know iLike was banned because of the acquisition by MySpace. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be an outright ban. Facebook has plenty of subtle ways of trainwrecking an application they don&#8217;t like. Keep an eye on this.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t Facebook just buy iLike? A matching or slightly better offer than the $20 million MySpace is paying would likely have gotten the deal done. And it may have saved Facebook from an embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>If I were MySpace, I&#8217;d focus on getting their free streaming music into the iLike Facebook application as soon as possible. Advertisers will love it.</p>
<p>This deal also shows what a top Facebook app is worth. Most of iLike&#8217;s activity comes through Facebook. They have 10 million monthly active users, and 31 million total Facebook installations (iLike has a total of over 50 million registered users). MySpace has valued that and the rest of iLike at $20 million, but has to factor in the possibility that Facebook will derail the application, subtly or overtly. If that risk wasn&#8217;t there, my guess is iLike would be worth 2-3x as much.</p>
<p><em>Why is MySpace and not MySpace Music buying iLike?</em> </p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing two reasons.The first is that MySpace Music, a joint venture with the music labels, isn&#8217;t going too well. The venture will lose at least $20 million this year on the back of massive royalty payments to the labels, and when the Google search deal <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/17/breaking-myspace-close-to-acquiring-ilike/">ends next year</a> the financial prospects of MySpace Music may get much, much worse. The last thing MySpace wants to do is put good money after bad and throw more assets into MySpace Music. Plus, the deal would likely have required notice to, if not the approval of, the label partners who own equity in the joint venture. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s another reason being talked about by our sources as well, though. iLike isn&#8217;t just about music and music recommendations. The platform they&#8217;ve built to facilitate artist-to-user publishing and user-to-user recommendations can be used for content beyond music, such as videos and games. Our guess is MySpace intends to integrate iLike&#8217;s technology into more than artist pages. So having the assets at MySpace makes sense.</p>
<p><em>MySpace Now Has Its Own Music Download Deals With Labels.</em></p>
<p>iLike launched its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/ilike-just-launched-its-own-music-download-store/">music download store</a> last week. MySpace Music has streaming rights to music but not download sales rights. Today <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/amazon-to-power-upcoming-myspace-music-downloads/">Amazon powers MySpace Music downloads</a>. I&#8217;m sure MySpace is now considering (or already decided to) moving to a direct sales approach via iLike&#8217;s deals and software.</p>

I believe in Twitter. I believe people want to use it and that it is useful to them. I'm less sure of its susceptibility to monetization, but then again, I cover <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/10/comparing-a-red-one-5d-mk-ii-and-panasonic-gh1-highly-illogical/">cameras </a>and <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/06/ramen-robot-makes-800-bowls-a-day-thats-almost-enough-for-me/">ramen-bots</a>, not internet business. Still, since I'm coming down to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/blog/">TechCrunch 50</a> conference in a few weeks, and will likely be the only person attending who does <em>not</em> use Twitter, I felt I should furnish an explanation. Not that I think it really matters to anyone whether I use it or not, but by striking preemptively, I'll avoid talking myself hoarse in explaining it repeatedly to those of you I meet. I'm also curious to see if there are any other "abstwainers" (or better yet, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotal">Tweetotallers</a>," either way I've coined a term) in the TechCrunch readership, and if so, what your perspective is.

Now, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been waiting for a chance to express myself on this (which may be why it is so <em>very </em>long (though my parenthetical style of writing shares the blame)), but it seems relevant enough and the timing is right. Please bear in mind that these are <em>my own reasons</em> for not using the service, not reasons for you to stop; I don't mean to proselytize. I'll start with my primary assertion: that <strong>a tweet is fundamentally valueless.</strong>]]></description>

<strong>A Manifesto</strong></p>
<p>I believe in Twitter. I believe people want to use it and that it is useful to them. I&#8217;m less sure of its susceptibility to monetization, but then again, I cover <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/10/comparing-a-red-one-5d-mk-ii-and-panasonic-gh1-highly-illogical/">cameras </a>and <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/06/ramen-robot-makes-800-bowls-a-day-thats-almost-enough-for-me/">ramen-bots</a>, not internet business. Still, since I&#8217;m coming down to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/blog/">TechCrunch 50</a> conference in a few weeks, and will likely be the only person attending who does <em>not</em> use Twitter, I felt I should furnish an explanation. Not that I think it really matters to anyone whether I use it or not, but by striking preemptively, I&#8217;ll avoid talking myself hoarse in explaining it repeatedly to those of you I meet. I&#8217;m also curious to see if there are any other &#8220;abstwainers&#8221; (or better yet, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotal">Tweetotallers</a>,&#8221; either way I&#8217;ve coined a term) in the TechCrunch readership, and if so, what your perspective is.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I hadn&#8217;t been waiting for a chance to express myself on this (which may be why it is so <em>very </em>long (though my parenthetical style of writing shares the blame)), but it seems relevant enough and the timing is right. Please bear in mind that these are <em>my own reasons</em> for not using the service, not reasons for you to stop; I don&#8217;t mean to proselytize. I&#8217;ll start with my primary assertion: that a tweet is fundamentally valueless.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twitter-bird-logo.jpg" alt="twitter-bird-logo" title="twitter-bird-logo" width="300" height="170" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107003" /><strong>Tweets have no value</strong></p>
<p>What is a tweet? It is a quantity of data which I believe to be useless, at least in this context. <strong>What can be said in 140 characters is either trivial or abridged; in the first case it would be better not to say it at all, and in the second case it would be better to give it the space it deserves.</strong> Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: &#8220;It&#8217;s a boy!&#8221; for instance, is both sufficient and worth telling everyone you know (incidentally, congratulations to CrunchGear writer Matt on the new baby), but I think we all know that the bulk of Twitter is not life-changing announcements or granules of compact wit and wisdom. Nor is it meant to be &mdash; but <em>intentions</em> aren&#8217;t admissible in <em>my</em> court, sir.</p>
<p>To proceed: the &#8220;this context&#8221; I mentioned above is simply that tweets are broadcast indiscriminately. I think this further devalues them; an otherwise acceptable message (&#8221;Brunch at Hi-Spot at 1!&#8221;) becomes impersonal and meaningless when it&#8217;s sent to so many. Yes, there is @ for specifying another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something else, this accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just exacerbates things. I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time &mdash; and shouting mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody&#8217;s name before the mundanity. Everyone else still has to listen. Conversation is impossible; every exchange is telegraphic (as is, unfortunately, increasingly true in other media).</p>
<p>But the tweet can have a link in it, of course, which makes it more versatile &mdash; except links are subject to the same value reductions as simple text. Tweeting a link is a lot like sending it to your whole address book. If you think <em>everyone you know</em> should see it, it better be <em>worth</em> shouting from the mountaintops. How rare that is! If you like other people finding your content for you, on their schedule, this isn&#8217;t a problem, but for me it is. Add in the fact that probably half of tweets are automatically generated, and what we&#8217;ve got here is a failure to communicate anything of value.</p>
<p>The natural objection to this is that you choose to follow people, you don&#8217;t have it forced upon you. True! I say, then, if someone is so regularly finding content of merit, why don&#8217;t they have a <em>blog</em> where the content can be given context, discussion, and perhaps a preview so people aren&#8217;t going in blind? I <em>like</em> reading interesting blogs. I <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to receive links every time someone find something they think everyone should see. Twitter just adds another layer to the equation &mdash; and I don&#8217;t like layers.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Every tweet out there is either unnecessary or unnecessarily abbreviated. Why would anyone <em>want</em> to be the owner of such an awkward little package of data?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/incomplete.png" alt="incomplete" title="incomplete" width="200" height="181" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107005" /><strong>It&#8217;s incomplete</strong></p>
<p>This one might be controversial, but I embrace controversy. I make it uncomfortable. I put my hands in its back pockets. I kiss it on the lips. Twitter, therefore, I say is an incomplete and clumsy service. The halo of Twitter meta-services is indicative (in my opinion) less of the popularity of the service and more of how it falls short of the mark. When it isn&#8217;t down, Twitter provides A; people want A, B, and C.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just text, sure, that&#8217;s what makes it Twitter &mdash; but simplicity isn&#8217;t the same as elegance (though the two are often seen together). URL-shortened image hosting services suggest people want to put their images right in the tweet-stream, or whatever you call it. Twitter applications like Tweetdeck (that&#8217;s one, right?) suggest that the web service is inadequate. And so on.</p>
<p>One <em>could</em> exaggerate the scope of Twitter&#8217;s service to being an alternative communication protocol at a basic level, like email or IM, and say that clients are a natural extension of that &mdash; but I think that&#8217;s disingenuous and wrong. Wrong because Twitter is meant to be <em>simple</em>, not <em>fundamental</em>. It&#8217;s a significant difference. Disingenuous because you know that&#8217;s not the case: if it were, Twitter would be better integrated with existing services.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not blaming Twitter for not being what <em>I</em> would have liked it to be &mdash; but to jump on a service that looks like a transitional form, so to speak, seems unwise if there is no utility in it. I&#8217;ll get on at Twitter 2.0, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>It replaces nothing and adds nothing</strong></p>
<p>What did you do before you tweeted? It&#8217;s the social equivalent of an all points bulletin, or&#8230; a quasar or something. What did you do before when you needed to send something of little consequence or urgency to a bunch of people who may or may not want to see it? The only thing that comes to mind is skywriting. Nowadays there are more ways than I can count. Twitter is certainly a big one, but is it really better, easier, or faster than its competitors &mdash; say, Facebook&#8217;s feed? To the untrained eye (that is to say, to <em>my </em>eye), it looks as if Facebook has Twitter humbled in many ways (though if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not much of a Facebooker either).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/whynot.png" alt="whynot" title="whynot" width="536" height="100" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107001" /></p>
<p>Twitter is certainly more mobile &mdash; that much I grant it; Facebook should be much better at that, and the FriendFeed acquisition should sew that up pretty tight in the months to come. Twitter is certainly much better for featurephones (as opposed to smartphones), but that&#8217;s a bit of a moving target, since featurephones are getting smart and smartphones are getting cheap. If I took a picture of something crazy with my phone, I&#8217;d rather send it to Facebook than Twitter, though with Twitter it would probably reach more people, because Facebook&#8217;s feed is almost as simple, and far more robust. It&#8217;s worth mentioning here that I&#8217;m pretty much talking out of my ass, though, because I&#8217;m not an especially active user of Facebook, and I may have mentioned that I don&#8217;t use Twitter at all. But if you would forbid the <em>argument ad ignorantium</em>, well, there goes the entire internet.</p>
<p><strong>News breaks alike on the followed and the unfollowed</strong></p>
<p>As for spreading news, there I can see it might be helpful for some. Not that the same news that gets broken on Twitter couldn&#8217;t have been broken somewhere else, but Twitter news does have a certain something. A certain urgency, since it&#8217;s part of an expanding wave of retweets, and you&#8217;re expected to tweet it forward. I&#8217;m sure some of you are wondering how a blogger can get by without using Twitter (Matt Hickey is, at least). I would remind you that this article is appearing on TechCrunch, the world&#8217;s leading source of Twitter-based news. Every tweet coming into existence has to be <em>personally approved</em> by Mike and MG before it appears for the rest of the internet. With these guys on watch, I&#8217;ve got nothing to worry about. (They could stand to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.80c182849ca932a32a5eda49e4fe1b02.3b1&#038;show_article=1">filter a bit more though</a>)</p>
<p>The point is that I don&#8217;t see any particular reason to use Twitter rather than, say, relying on Facebook or RSS or even email. If it&#8217;s hot, it&#8217;ll spread one way or the other. And unfortunately, I can&#8217;t think of a less suggestive way of saying that.</p>
<p>Besides, (and I hate to trot out this old argument, but I think it&#8217;s applicable here) weren&#8217;t we saturated with information <em>before</em> Twitter came on the scene? Do we really need a constant hail of tweets in addition to the emails, IMs, messages, posts, votes, invitations, events, feeds, and god knows what else? I say thee nay! And on that point:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vanity.jpg" alt="vanity" title="vanity" width="250" height="393" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107016" /><strong>It&#8217;s pure vanity</strong></p>
<p>This may sound a bit rich coming from a <em>professional blogger</em>, but I don&#8217;t like to broadcast myself. Before this post I have tried to restrict my self-reference on this blog and CrunchGear to things like &#8220;I&#8217;m more of a Canon guy, but&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;SNES will always be superior to Genesis.&#8221; I think advertising yourself overtly or deliberately drawing attention is in poor taste, whether it&#8217;s tweeting your latest action, or having really big hair, or making everyone listen to your joke at a party. Vanity! Twitter encourages it. This is more of a philosophical point, so I won&#8217;t argue it too much here, but it&#8217;s my position that people should be saying fewer, more meaningful things, directed at people to whom they are relevant &mdash; as opposed to the equivalent of sending up a signal flare and screaming that you super hate mondays, blah!</p>
<p>It appeals to the reptilian part of the brain, I think. It&#8217;s an alpha male thing, having followers. When you&#8217;re broadcasting, you get to think people are paying attention, and who doesn&#8217;t like attention? But our attention is spread so thin these days that the portion devoted to something as minor as a tweet may as well be none at all. Broadcasting may console the ego, but it&#8217;s false consolation. What it is a surrogate for (meaningful attention) can&#8217;t be gotten that way.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you tweet?</strong></p>
<p>But enough of that. I could probably rattle off a couple more paragraphs on this and that, but I don&#8217;t want to abuse the reader&#8217;s patience. 1800 words is 1796 too many, when I could have simply pulled a Bartleby and said &#8220;I prefer not to.&#8221; You must understand, I thought it worth a thorough examining, considering TechCrunch and Twitter are joined at the hip. I console myself in that this article, though overlong to a degree you all will be revealing to me shortly, has still far fewer words than are found in an average week&#8217;s posts on Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/why-we-tweet.jpg" alt="why-we-tweet" title="why-we-tweet" width="200" height="134" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107022" />So here&#8217;s my question to you. <strong>Why do you, or why don&#8217;t you, use Twitter?</strong> This isn&#8217;t a trap; I&#8217;m genuinely curious, since it seems to provide some things for many, many things for some, and nothing to a (talented and handsome) few. Anything so polarizing is worth discussion, so &mdash; discuss.</p>
<p>I only forbid one answer: &#8220;because everyone else is doing it.&#8221; That&#8217;s the same reason people wore Hammer pants.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Good to see so many responses. Very interesting. So much venom, though!]

That's odd since the service has now gone from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">completely shutting down</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/trim-cuts-off-bitlys-301works-idea-wants-to-sell/">trying hard to sell</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/trim-we-were-just-kidding-about-cutting-you-off-also-were-still-for-sale/">bringing the service back up</a> so it can sell, to now going open source in just 8 days.

Let me be clear, going open source is a great idea, I'm not sure if it will <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">help Tr.im all that much</a>, but on paper it sounds great. That's what they should have done originally. But <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/165049236/tr-im-to-be-community-owned">in a post today</a> on Tr.im's blog the service first apologizes for this whole fiasco, and then attempts to place blame elsewhere. As I read it, it's either Bit.ly's fault for making a low-ball offer to buy the Tr.im, Twitter's fault for picking Bit.ly over Tr.im as its URL shortener of choice, <a href="http://301works.org/">301works.org</a>'s fault for being a "public relations stunt", and yes, even TechCrunch's fault because we "simply repeat vertbatim what twitter/bit.ly feeds [us]".]]></description>

<p>Let me be clear, going open source is a great idea, I&#8217;m not sure if it will <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">help Tr.im all that much</a>, but on paper it sounds great. That&#8217;s what they should have done originally. But <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/165049236/tr-im-to-be-community-owned">in a post today</a> on Tr.im&#8217;s blog the service first apologizes for this whole fiasco, and then attempts to place blame elsewhere. As I read it, it&#8217;s either Bit.ly&#8217;s fault for making a low-ball offer to buy the Tr.im, Twitter&#8217;s fault for picking Bit.ly over Tr.im as its URL shortener of choice, <a href="http://301works.org/">301works.org</a>&#8217;s fault for being a &#8220;public relations stunt&#8221;, and yes, even TechCrunch&#8217;s fault because we &#8220;simply repeat vertbatim what twitter/bit.ly feeds [us]&#8220;.</p>
<p>Let me again be clear: We received no shortage of tips from very good sources last week about what Tr.im was doing behind the scenes while all of this played out. Not one of those tips was from either Bit.ly or Twitter or anyone directly related to them. Instead, they came from third-parties who were actively or passively pursuing a Tr.im acquisition. For example, we heard the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/nambu-wants-80k-100k-for-trim-considers-shutting-down-its-twitter-client/">$80,000 to $100,000 figure</a> Nambu wanted for Tr.im from no less than three sources. And even more sources came forward to say they had heard that general price range as well and thought it was unreasonable, especially considering how Nambu handled the Tr.im situation, losing user trust in the process. So is it really any surprise today that they announce they&#8217;re going open source?</p>
<p>Does it suck that Twitter&#8217;s choice of Bit.ly made it hard for services like Tr.im to operate? Sure. But plenty of others are still out there doing it rather than descending into conspiracy theories. And it&#8217;s just poor form to drag other services into this mess, like <a href="http://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a>, which is trying to do a good thing with 301works.org. Yes, it was Bit.ly&#8217;s idea, but Gnip is now handling it as a independant third-party, and no shortage of other URL shortening services have joined on. Obviously, some of those services probably don&#8217;t like that Twitter chose Bit.ly, but they deal with it and realize that a movement like this is worth teaming up with rivals for the good of all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It saddens me that this is how Tr.im is portraying 301works,</em>&#8221; Gnip&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-marcoullier">Eric Marcoullier</a> told us today. He went on to reiterate that Gnip is simply serving as an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/following-the-trim-incident-301works-is-ready-to-insure-shortened-urls/">independant third party for the project</a>, attempting to do something good and useful. And while <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/trim_to_go_open_source_community_owned.php">a ReadWriteWeb article</a> on the matter today seemed to suggest that Tr.im was working actively with Gnip for this new crowd-sourced Tr.im, Marcoullier notes that anyone is free to push data through Gnip, but that he hasn&#8217;t specifically talked to Nambu about how Tr.im will use it. He also notes that since Tr.im will now be open source, he hopes the community behind it makes its data a part of 301works.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Tr.im to try and clear up their misplaced anger about this, but have yet to hear back. If we do, we will update.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/boxers-215x151.png" width="215" height="151" />Live video streaming service <a href="http://www.ustream.tv">Ustream</a> is being sued by Square Ring, Inc, a boxing promotional company owned by professional boxer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Jones_Jr.">Roy Jones, Jr.</a>  The suit alleges that Ustream has committed "massive and blatant copyright infringement" by allowing 2,377 users to view a broadcast of the fight <i>Roy Jones Jr. vs Omar Sheika</i> free of charge.  Furthermore, the suit says that Ustream has ignored repeated requests by Square Ring Inc. to gather more information about the infringement.  From the suit:



<blockquote>Following the illegal exhibition of Plaintiff's Copyrighted Broadcast on USTREAM's website on March 21, 2009, notifying Defendants of the copyright and trademark infringements and, in a good faith effort to avoid litigation, requested information pursuant to Rules 26 and 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  </blockquote>]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/boxers.png" class="shot2"/>Live video streaming service <a href="http://www.ustream.tv">Ustream</a> is being sued by Square Ring, Inc, a boxing promotional company owned by professional boxer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Jones_Jr.">Roy Jones, Jr.</a>  The suit alleges that Ustream has committed &#8220;massive and blatant copyright infringement&#8221; by allowing 2,377 users to view a broadcast of the fight <i>Roy Jones Jr. vs Omar Sheika</i> free of charge.  Furthermore, the suit says that Ustream has ignored repeated requests by Square Ring Inc. to gather more information about the infringement.  From the suit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following the illegal exhibition of Plaintiff&#8217;s Copyrighted Broadcast on USTREAM&#8217;s website on March 21, 2009, notifying Defendants of the copyright and trademark infringements and, in a good faith effort to avoid litigation, requested information pursuant to Rules 26 and 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiff&#8217;s letter further advised Defendants that, to Plaintiff&#8217;s knowledge, they permitted approximately 2,377 users to view Plaintiff&#8217;s pay-per-view program completely free of charge, in violation of Plaintiff&#8217;s rights.  To date, Defendants have neither complied with Plaintiff&#8217;s request nor responded to Plaintiff&#8217;s letter&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The court document, embedded below, also details Square Ring&#8217;s attempts to proactively prevent the event from being pirated.  According to the suit, Square Ring sent Ustream four notices in the week leading up to the fight, asking that the service either provide a &#8216;take down tool&#8217;, or that it have staff actively monitor and delete any streams of the fight.  The document says that while some other sites did provide take-down tools, Ustream did not cooperate.</p>
<p>Ustream has given us the following statement regarding the suit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ustream is serious about complying with the copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and we&#8217;re aggressively taking short- and long-term steps to work with the content industry to meet their needs. We believe the Square Ring lawsuit does not have merit and that we&#8217;re fully protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act Safe Harbor provisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piracy is a problem that has long plagued live video sites like Ustream and its competitors, which include <a href="http://www.justin.tv">Justin.tv</a>.  Because content is being streamed by users, it can be difficult for the services to monitor and prevent copyrighted material from being streamed.  But while they&#8217;d never admit it, piracy can also help these sites establish sizable user bases — one need only look to YouTube for proof, which was a hotbed for pirated material in its early days and was later acquired by Google for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/09/google-has-acquired-youtube/">$1.65 billion</a>.</p>

Local news always seems to get the short end of the stick, both in terms of coverage and advertising dollars.  And as the entire newspaper industry continues to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/29/the-wounded-us-newspaper-industry-lost-75-billion-in-advertising-revenues-last-year/">struggle for survival</a>, the prospects for local news looks particularly bleak.  It just doesn't pay to have a reporter cover a neighborhood farmer's market when she could be covering the Mayor's office or something with broader appeal.  And so traditional news organizations are abandoning local and hyperlocal news.

Don't worry, though.  Media consultant, <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">blogger</a>, and CUNY professor <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a> has a few ideas for how to replace the local newspaper with <a href="http://newsinnovation.com/models/">new business models for news</a> at the hyperlocal level.  He just gave a <a href="http://prezi.com/145895/">presentation</a> at an Aspen Institute forum on journalism today (<a href="http://www.groundreport.com/aspeninstitute/">live stream</a>).  

His answer is to organize local bloggers and citizens into a metro-wide network in each of the top 25 markets, and sell local ads across their sites.  Each hyperlocal site would remain independent but join a loose federation for ad sales, distribution, and shared costs.  Jarvis sketches out what a new news organization might look like at the local level, and goes out on a limb by offering actual spreadsheets showing some assumptions about <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag8pC7YITnAMdGhGenp3QmxOZFE0ZjBjVlV1bzU4UUE&#038;hl=en">audience size </a> and how the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag8pC7YITnAMdDN1VnlmOFBJMGptcHU1cGttNTlsOVE&#038;hl=en">business model</a> would work.

<p>Local news always seems to get the short end of the stick, both in terms of coverage and advertising dollars.  And as the entire newspaper industry continues to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/29/the-wounded-us-newspaper-industry-lost-75-billion-in-advertising-revenues-last-year/">struggle for survival</a>, the prospects for local news looks particularly bleak.  It just doesn&#8217;t pay to have a reporter cover a neighborhood farmer&#8217;s market when she could be covering the Mayor&#8217;s office or something with broader appeal.  And so traditional news organizations are abandoning local and hyperlocal news.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, though.  Media consultant, <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/">blogger</a>, and CUNY professor <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a> has a few ideas for how to replace the local newspaper with <a href="http://newsinnovation.com/models/">new business models for news</a> at the hyperlocal level.  He just gave a <a href="http://prezi.com/145895/">presentation</a> at an Aspen Institute forum on journalism today (<a href="http://www.groundreport.com/aspeninstitute/">live stream</a>).  </p>
<p>His answer is to organize local bloggers and citizens into a metro-wide network in each of the top 25 markets, and sell local ads across their sites.  Each hyperlocal site would remain independent but join a loose federation for ad sales, distribution, and shared costs.  Jarvis sketches out what a new news organization might look like at the local level, and goes out on a limb by offering actual spreadsheets showing some assumptions about <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag8pC7YITnAMdGhGenp3QmxOZFE0ZjBjVlV1bzU4UUE&#038;hl=en">audience size </a> and how the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag8pC7YITnAMdDN1VnlmOFBJMGptcHU1cGttNTlsOVE&#038;hl=en">business model</a> would work.  There is also a spreadsheet for doing this through a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag8pC7YITnAMdDN1VnlmOFBJMGptcHU1cGttNTlsOVE&#038;hl=en">non-profit.</a></p>
<p>As everyone from Esther Dyson to Michael Kinsley and Marissa Mayer pointed out at the forum, the numbers don&#8217;t look very realistic.  The model assumes in a metro market of 5 million people, the hyperlocal network will be able to get 1.75 million readers (35 percent penetration) in Year 1, growing to 3 million readers (60 percent penetration) in Year 3.  The corresponding revenues for each market go from $5 million in Year 1 to $20 million in Year 3. </p>
<p>For a large local blog, that could translate into total revenues of $126,976 in Year 1, going to $331,640 in Year 2, with corresponding income for the blogger of $42,777 in the first year, going to $148, 269 in the third (see table below).</p>
<p>These numbers are way too optimistic.   In order to get to those revenue numbers, the model had to be pumped up with SMS alerts, Twitter coupons, a &#8220;donation system for watchdog journalism,&#8221; and other lines of revenue which may never an out.  Most people are just not that interested in what is going on in their neighborhoods. A local blog network would be lucky to get 20 percent of a metro area&#8217;s population as regular readers across multiple sites.   </p>
<p>Former Slate editor Michael Kinsley asked Jarvis, &#8220;If it is as easy as you make it sound, why aren’t you off doing it?.&#8221;  Google product chief Marissa Mayer was a little more diplomatic, but suggested the numbers need a &#8220;sanity check.&#8221;  </p>
<p>To be fair, Jarvis and CUNY are presenting the models for discussion and to show how an alternative, semi-distributed local news organization might emerge that can pay for itself.  The numbers are wrong, but that hardly matters.  They are a starting point for a reconception of how local news can be organized.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you reinventing the wheel?&#8221; Kinsley asked him.  &#8220;I think it needs some reinvention,&#8221; responded Jarvis. &#8220;We wanted to see if there is a vision for the future of journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jarvis was asked who the dominant species would be in this new ecosystem, he answered: &#8220;No one owns the whole thing anymore. No one can afford to own it anymore.  So the key thing is how do you take part in the network.&#8221;  His numbers might be way off, but at least he is trying to rethink the news.</p>

He wrote about Steve Jobs without actually being allowed to talk to the man and the resulting tale sounds more like <a HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/jun/04/netnotes.markoliver">a Mark Oliver profile of the Bilderbergers</a> than a fluff piece on a popular company. However, what Appleyard did come away with was a picture of a company so strange and dysfunctional it makes most Communist dictatorships look like fantasy football leagues.

One of the best paragraphs describes Apple's development style:

<blockquote>The answer is that, along with computers, iPhones and iPods, secrecy is one of Apple’s signature products. A cult of corporate omerta — the mafia code of silence — is ruthlessly enforced, with employees sacked for leaks and careless talk. Executives feed deliberate misinformation into one part of the company so that any leak can be traced back to its source. Workers on sensitive projects have to pass through many layers of security. Once at their desks or benches, they are monitored by cameras and they must cover up devices with black cloaks and turn on red warning lights when they are uncovered. “The secrecy is beyond fastidious and is in fact insultingly petty and political,” says one employee on the anonymous corporate reporting site Glassdoor.com, “and often is an impediment to actually getting one’s work done.”</blockquote>

<p>And we&#8217;re surprised there was a <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/24/some-of-the-facts-on-the-apple-suicide/">suicide</a>?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: when you&#8217;re working on the new iPhone they&#8217;re going to watch you and turn on a Red Light Special lamp over your head. As Jef Raskin notes, Jobs would have been an &#8220;excellent king of France.&#8221;</p>
<p>But will we listen? Will we ever tear down this cult of personality? Probably not. Apple does what Apple does and we - though increasingly fewer of us - walk in lock-step. Writing about the company is surprisingly hard and going past the obvious PR and marketing layer is difficult. Even Appleyard had a heck of a time and it shows in this piece. Instead of Jobs being described as a nice guy who drives to work and makes phones he becomes a &#8220;productive narcissist&#8221; with daddy issues and who could be compared with a syphilitic Bourbon potentate. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to write a few more words and then encourage you to go read the piece. Today when I went to <a HREF="http://apple.com">Apple.com</a> for something or the other I felt a little tinge of revulsion. This has been Apple&#8217;s summer, whether it wanted it to be or not. We&#8217;re talking about <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/17/review-snow-leopard-10a432/">Snow Leopard</a> and tablets and prototypes and all this jazz and we&#8217;re all amped up on fermented Apple juice. I kind of feel that no, Apple, doesn&#8217;t deserve all this attention and that Windows 7 need a little love and what about the <a HREf="http://www.crunchgear.com/search/creative+zii">Creative Zii</a>…</p>
<p>But just as no IT guy will get fired for buying Microsoft, no blogger will get fired for writing about Apple. For better or worse Jobs&#8217; strange strategy worked. Comparing Apple with other computer companies is almost impossible. Through force of will and a strange internal culture, Apple has left the map entirely and is operating in its own rarified astral plane. I wonder, however, how many of us want to keep looking up when there&#8217;s great stuff right in front of us.

Even though they haven't really found a big audience yet, hyperlocal news sites are becoming a hot commodity.  In June, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/11/aol-buys-local-startups-going-and-patch-and-ceo-tim-armstrong-brings-an-investment-in-house/">AOL bought Patch</a> for $7 million, and today <a href=" http://blog.everyblock.com/2009/aug/17/acquisition/">MSNBC acquired EveryBlock</a>.  EveryBlock was previously funded by a grant from the Knight Foundation, which ended in June.  The five employees will now work at MSNBC.

The price was not disclosed, but like the Patch acquisition, it is not an audience acquisition.  Rather it is a hyperlocal platform play which MSNBC can now plug into its site and push in a major way.  <a href="http://www.everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a> is a hyperlocal news aggregator, bringing in geo-specific feeds from neighborhood blogs, Flickr, Yelp, Craigslist, and elsewhere to give readers a picture of what is going on in their town or neighborhood.  ]]></description>

<p>EveryBlock currently covers only about 15 cities in the U.S. and comScore estimates its U.S. audience to be only 143,000 unique visitors  a month (July, 2009).  In contrast, competitor <a href="http://outside.in/">Outside.in</a> attracts 800,000 unique visitors in the U.S.  These are relatively small numbers, but these services do a good job of collecting neighborhood news without the expense of actually reporting it.</p>

Sorry. I'm just a crank. Every time Apple comes out with a new version of OS X I expect bells, whistles, and dancing dogs. This is an incremental upgrade, as we described it back at WWDC, and it's a strong one. However, it's not nearly as exciting at first blush - at least visually - but it does give countless IT guys some serious tentpole action especially considering built-in Exchange support.

This review is based on the purported Gold Master, 10A432, the version that will be shipped to stores world-wide this September. It may or not be the official final version but I've been using versions of Snow Leopard for about two months now.]]></description>

And it&#8217;s no stranger to large-scale live podcasts, as some pull in more than 20,000 listeners while they&#8217;re going on. But on Wednesday, the service is likely to see their popularity taken to the next level as none other than the President of the United States will be on a program live for the site.</p>
<p>President Obama will be making an appearance on a special program called &#8220;<a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/40mins4health">40 Minutes For Health Reform</a>&#8221; which will stream live exclusively on BlogTalkRadio. Specifically, the President&#8217;s part will be the last 10 minutes of the show after he listens in on the first 30 minutes during which there will be a roundtable discussion about the topic with the leaders of the non-profit group, Faithful America.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithfulamerica.org/">Faithful America</a> are the ones that came up with the idea of doing a program on BlogTalkRadio, as they were looking for a platform to have moderated dialogue in a social media environment. The White House was open to the idea as they look to garner support for their health agenda. It&#8217;s a subject which has gathered <a href="http://www.memeorandum.com/090816/p56#a090816p56">quite a bit of controversy</a> in the past few days, as there is talk that the administration may have to back away from some of its original plan.</p>
<p>For many of its shows, BlogTalkRadio utilizes social media outreach via the normal channels: Twitter, Facebook, etc. But this program should spread faster than the others given that the President will be on it talking about something which is now somewhat controversial. Still, the administration hasn&#8217;t shied away from using these new forms of communication to get messages out even though things aren&#8217;t quite as controlled as they might be with the standard outlets.</p>
<p>“<em>I’ve been impressed by how President Obama has adopted innovative social-media technology during his campaign and into his administration,</em>” says <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-levy">Alan Levy</a>, CEO of BlogTalkRadio.  “<em>We’re honored that he has selected BlogTalkRadio as his newest requisite platform for communicating directly with the American people.</em>”</p>
<p>The show will air live on Wednesday at 5 PM ET (2 PM PT) on both BlogTalkRadio&#8217;s program page <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/40mins4health">found here</a>, and on the <a href="http://faithforhealth.org/">Faith For Health</a> site.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/myspaceilike-215x140.jpg" width="215" height="140" />

MySpace is close to acquiring popular social music service <a href="http://www.ilike.com">iLike</a>, we've confirmed with multiple sources. The deal, which should close this week, will be MySpace's first acquisition since new CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta">Owen Van Natta</a> took <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/24/news-corp-pulls-the-trigger-owen-van-vatta-now-runs-myspace/">control</a> of the company in April 2009. The price is "around $20 million."

iLike, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/24/ilike-brings-free-indy-music-to-itunes-recommendations">launched</a> in late 2006, is a social music recommendation service that now has more than 50 million registered users. It tracks what you listen to and like and gives you recommendations on new music based on that data as well as what your friends are listening to. It is the top music application on Facebook, Bebo, Hi5 and just about every other social network other than MySpace, which has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/25/myspace-music-puts-the-industry-on-the-right-track/">MySpace Music</a>.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/myspaceilike.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot" alt="" />MySpace is close to acquiring popular social music service <a href="http://www.ilike.com">iLike</a>, we&#8217;ve confirmed with multiple sources. The deal, which should close this week, will be MySpace&#8217;s first acquisition since new CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta">Owen Van Natta</a> took <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/24/news-corp-pulls-the-trigger-owen-van-vatta-now-runs-myspace/">control</a> of the company in April 2009. The price is &#8220;around $20 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>iLike, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/24/ilike-brings-free-indy-music-to-itunes-recommendations">launched</a> in late 2006, is a social music recommendation service that now has more than 50 million registered users. It tracks what you listen to and like and gives you recommendations on new music based on that data as well as what your friends are listening to. It is the top music application on Facebook, Bebo, Hi5 and just about every other social network other than MySpace, which has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/25/myspace-music-puts-the-industry-on-the-right-track/">MySpace Music</a>.</p>
<p>iLike also hosts band pages which are second in popularity only to MySpace Music. By acquiring iLike, MySpace solidifies their already leading position as the most popular online identity for bands. Last week iLike also launched their own <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/ilike-just-launched-its-own-music-download-store/">music download store</a>.</p>
<p>Details are still flying in, but at first blush the deal is particularly interesting for two reasons. </p>
<p>First, simply because iLike is so deeply integrated into the Facebook experience. Nearly 10 million Facebook users use the iLike application every month. And iLike has also been a key part of Facebook&#8217;s ongoing struggles with <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/23/facebook-dreams-of-easy-music-while-religious-battle-rages-internally/">what-to-do-about-music</a>. MySpace is now  going to own this.</p>
<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fbilike.jpg'  class=border alt='' /></p>
<p>Second, it&#8217;s MySpace, not the MySpace Music joint venture with the music labels, that is acquiring iLike. We&#8217;ll have more to say on this shortly. We&#8217;re hearing that a key driver of the deal is the iLike team, particularly founders <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ali-partovi">Ali Partovi</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/hadi-partovi">Hadi Partovi</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nat-brown">Nat Brown</a>, and the underlying technology.</p>
<p>Competitor <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/cbs-acquires-lastfm-for-280m/">Last.fm was acquired by CBS</a> in 2007 for $280 million. June 2009 Comscore stats show Last.fm with 12.9 million monthly unique visitors. iLike had just 3 million monthly unique visitors, but that doesn&#8217;t take into account the massive usage of the service on social networks.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike">$16.5 million</a> from the founders, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/scott-banister">Scott Banister</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bob-pittman">Bob Pittman</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/vinod-khosla">Vinod Khosla</a> and Ticketmaster to date. But their last round of funding was in 2006, where Ticketmaster put the bulk of the capital in via a third round of financing that valued the company at a whopping $53.2 million.</p>
<p>In Q4 2008 Ticketmaster <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS207759%2B19-Mar-2009%2BGNW20090319">wrote down</a> a number of their venture investments, including a $5.8 million charge for iLike. Internally, they valued that $13.3 million investment at just $7.5 million. Last month we reported that iLike was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/ilike-negotiating-a-reorganization-ticketmaster-may-be-flushed-out/">considering</a> a new round of financing that would cash TicketMaster out of the company.</p>
<p>Neither MySpace nor iLike would comment on this story.</p>

We'll probably have some more details on this later today, but we're able to spill some of it now seeing as much of it just went live on Samsung's own site.

If you haven't been keeping up with all the latest in Samsung news, here's what you need to know: Samsung's got a widget interface called TouchWiz, which they've been rolling out across their touchscreen phones since around June of last year. You've got a drawer containing some widgets, and four flickable pages to toss these widgets onto. So far, they've got it up and running on Windows Mobile, Symbian, and Samsung's own proprietary OS. TouchWiz looks and behaves more or less identically on all of these platforms, providing some degree of uniform user experience across vastly different interfaces.

We haven't been huge fans of TouchWiz thus far, largely because of its lack of expandability. Each TouchWiz-enabled device came with 10-15 widgets, and that was that. If you wanted to download more, you were out of luck. If you wanted to make your own, that was just too bad. That's all about to change.]]></description>

One of our reliable sources told us today that they had reason to believe both CBS/CNET and Amazon were considering acquiring the company. After some digging, we've confirmed that CBS has considered investing in GDGT and that their subsidiary CNET has ongoing partnership discussions, but isn't considering an acquisition right now. Amazon, though, is more interesting. They've been doing quiet background due diligence on GDGT's founders and developers, we've heard, which is an indication that they may be interested in buying.

Amazon has experimented with pure content sites the last few years, launching a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/25/hey-thats-pretty-smart-amazon-launches-a-gadget-blog/">bunch of blogs</a> and even <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/14/amazon-acquires-dpreviewcom/">buying UK-based DPReview</a>, a camera review blog, in 2007.  Content, particularly reviews, are great for SEO and cross promotion. And to Amazon's credit, they haven't defiled <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">DPReview</a> much at all.

...and GDGT is certainly off to an amazing start. They had a massive <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/gdgt-draws-47-million-views-during-wwdc-keynote-not-bad-for-a-site-that-hasnt-launched/">4.7 million pageview</a> traffic day back in June, <em>before they launched the main site.</em> Compete shows a <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/gdgt.com/">nice spike</a> in U.S. visitors, without the usual post launch sag (yet).]]></description>

Although I've now cancelled my SpinVox subscription, I know (because CIO Rob Wheatley told me) that SpinVox, like Google, keeps data - which in SpinVox's case means recordings of your messages - "for as long as possible". Based on a quick search of my inbox, I reckon SpinVox are holding recordings of about 250 messages that were left for me between April and July of this year.

But that's not really the problem. After all, Google knows a lot more about me than that and I'm sure my ISP and the government do too. My concern is that I believe the majority of my messages were listened to by a person I don't know in another country. That's the point at which SpinVox may be falling foul of UK and European data regulations, and it's the weak link in the privacy chain. So it's time to find out if SpinVox is being honest enough with its customers about the proportion of messages that are read by humans - and also about how much of those messages are seen by call centre staff.

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rocket-fuel-logo.png" width="212" height="80" /> 

A team of Yahoo veterans who built its behavioral targeting advertising technology are publicly launching a hybrid ad network today called<a href="http://www.rocketfuelinc.com/"> Rocket Fuel</a>, which they've tested over the past year with <a href="http://rocketfuelinc.com/html/advertisers/brands.html">major brands</a> including Nike, Dell, Microsoft, and American Express.  Despite keeping quiet, Rocket Fuel's ad network reaches 40 million people and shows them about 100 million ads per month. 

CEO George John calls Rocket Fuel a "hybrid ad network" because it combines all sorts of targeting data (social, behavioral, contextual, geographical, search) to figure out what works best at any particular moment.  "We saw how important it was to let the data tell you which ad to show," says John, who came from Yahoo along with president Richard Frankel and CTO Abhinav Gupta.]]></description>

<p>A team of Yahoo veterans who built its behavioral targeting advertising technology are publicly launching a hybrid ad network today called<a href="http://www.rocketfuelinc.com/"> Rocket Fuel</a>, which they&#8217;ve tested over the past year with <a href="http://rocketfuelinc.com/html/advertisers/brands.html">major brands</a> including Nike, Dell, Microsoft, and American Express.  Despite keeping quiet, Rocket Fuel&#8217;s ad network reaches 40 million people and shows them about 100 million ads per month. </p>
<p>CEO George John calls Rocket Fuel a &#8220;hybrid ad network&#8221; because it combines all sorts of targeting data (social, behavioral, contextual, geographical, search) to figure out what works best at any particular moment.  &#8220;We saw how important it was to let the data tell you which ad to show,&#8221; says John, who came from Yahoo along with president Richard Frankel and CTO Abhinav Gupta.</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel&#8217;s algorithm considers everything from a consumer&#8217;s online behavior and location to the time of day and what particular ad was shown.  If people who listen to electronica music are more likely to click on an ad than those who listen to jazz, or people who log in from work respond better than people from home, Rocket Fuel tries to ferret out those details and feed them back into the mechanics of the ad campaign. John explains:</p>
<p><em>We let the data tell us what works and what is important. Instead of inflicting on customers thousands of targeting options, we figure out which options are working well and move inventory in that way.</em></p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but apparently this is not the way most ad targeting is done.  Instead, advertisers and ad agencies typically are given a confusing array of targeting options and are left to their own devices to sort through them all.  Rocket Fuel is automating that testing process and speeding up the feedback loop so that advertisers can hone in on whatever combination of targeting is working at that second.</p>
<p>But does the world really need another advertising network, hybrid or otherwise?  If Rocket Fuel can deliver better advertising campaign ROIs, advertisers will give it a shot.  That&#8217;s all that matters.  If it can&#8217;t, it won&#8217;t make it off the launchpad.</p>
<p>The companyl raised $6.8 million in a series A round a year ago from Mohr Davidow, Labrador Ventures, and individual angel investors.</p>

<p>Y Combinator&#8217;s RFSes won&#8217;t describe exactly what Y Combinator is looking for, but rather will give a general idea, with the hopes that the startups can come up with even better plans than Y Combinator is thinking of, Graham says.</p>
<p>So what is the first RFS? Well, it&#8217;s something near and dear to our hearts: <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html">The Future Of Journalism</a>. Y Combinator is wondering what the online content sites will look like in the future when <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/16/the-media-bundle-is-dead-long-live-the-news-aggregators/">print publications are gone</a>. Certainly some, like TechCrunch, have gotten large enough to support themselves now, but most content sites are still built on the notion of content first, monetization later. Y Combinator notes that in the heyday of print media, the approach was often the opposite, there was a business plan in place before the launch. It believes that approach can still work, and has laid out a rough outline of what it&#8217;s looking for from startups that want to do this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Groups applying to work on this idea should include at least one writer who can write well and rapidly about any topic, one or more programmers who are good at statistics, data mining, and making sites scale, and someone who&#8217;s reasonably competent at graphic design.  These functions can of course be combined, and in fact it&#8217;s even better if they are. Xooglers would be particularly well suited to this project.</p></blockquote>
<p>This RFS is just the first of 3 to 5 that Y Combinator hopes to get out there before the October 26 Winter 2010 class application deadline, Graham tells us. Startups applying specifically for these RFS ideas will be able to indicate that on their applications.</p>
<p>Graham notes that Y Combinator has sort of passively given ideas to startups in the past, <a href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html">like this</a>, but thinks this new explicit call will lead to some interesting things.</p>
<p>We asked Graham if this new approach means these types of startups will get different financial deals from Y Combinator. &#8220;<em>Not significantly,</em>&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;<em>Execution matters so much more than the idea that even if we supplied the entire idea we wouldn&#8217;t be entitled to more than 10% of the company,</em>&#8221; he notes. On his post he gives a bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>We might ask for a little more equity from startups responding to an RFS, because we&#8217;d expect to contribute more to them.  But at most a percent or two, and often nothing.  Ideas count for something, but execution matters far more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/that-whining-sound-you-hear-is-the-death-wheeze-of-newspapers/">go again</a>. The newspaper industry is blaming online news aggregators for its dwindling profits and inability to adapt to a world of links and truly-free flowing information.  (They like it when information flows freely into their pages, but not so much when it flows out).  </p>
<p>On Thursday, paidContent ran an essay by media consultant Arnon Mishkin called <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-the-fallacy-of-the-link-economy/">&#8220;The Fallacy Of The Link Economy&#8221;</a> which was <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2009/08/14/on-the-link-economy/">misguided on so many levels</a>.  Mishkin&#8217;s main argument is that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the value gets captured by aggregators linking and scraping rather than by the news organizations that get linked and scraped.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not really clear whom he is calling an aggregator—actual news aggregators like Yahoo News, Google News, Digg, Techmeme and the Huffington Post, or anyone who links to a news story.  After all, he equates the entire web to the blogosphere, which says more about his parochial industry view than about the web.  In his mind, the web is the enemy and links are bad.</p>
<p>What really seems to concern him, however, are news aggregation sites. They threaten newspapers because they are emerging as the new front page which people skim every morning for headlines instead of going to any single newspaper site.  Mishkin argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, the value of those casual browsers was captured by the newspaper because the readers would have to buy a copy.  Now all the value gets captured by the aggregator that scrapes the copy and creates a front page that a set of readers choose to scan. </p></blockquote>
<p>Set aside for a second that ads on news aggregation sites are usually worth a lot less than ads on original content sites and thus they are not capturing the same value.  More to the point, when I first read this my <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287210941">immediate response</a> was that the value of news sites does not come from getting people to skim headlines, but to actually click through and read the actual stories.  The newspaper industry wants to go back to the world before the Web, when each newspaper was a small media bundle packed with stories, 80 percent of which sucked.  But it didn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;d gladly pay a dollar to read the one or two stories that caught your eye on the front page, hoping there would be more inside.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?   <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287258566">The media bundle is dead.</a>  News sites can no longer capture reader&#8217;s attention with 20 percent news, and <a href="http://twitter.com/erickschonfeld/status/3287251428">80 percent suck</a>.  Each story stands on its own in a world of atomized content where readers can come from anywhere on the Web, not just the front page.  Now in addition to the front page, there are a million side doors.  Reader lock-in is gone. The sooner newspapers get used to that concept, the sooner they can start to adapt and survive.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the value of news aggregators. The newspaper industry is looking for someone to blame.  Usually, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/11/does-google-really-control-the-news/">it&#8217;s Google</a>, but really anyone on the Web will do.  Rather than blame the aggregators, news site should take advantage of them.  On the Web, every side door can be a front page, whether it is Google News or search or Digg or Twitter or a feed reader or My Yahoo.  I&#8217;ve said this before about Google, but it applies to any site that links to the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google does not control the news, it exposes it.  . . . It is incumbent upon each of us to attract an audience by having something original or interesting to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if a news site or a blog can say enough interesting things enough times that news aggregators (or other sites) keep linking to them, then they can build up their brand and reader loyalty.  Maybe readers will click on those links if they see it is coming from a trusted source, and then maybe some of those will start coming to the news site itself on a regular basis.  But that loyalty must be earned every day, story by story, post by post.  The more front pages (or side pages) which point to a news site&#8217;s stories, the more chances it has to gain that loyalty.  </p>
<p>But the days of the media bundle when readers got all of the day&#8217;s news from one site are long gone. So too are gone the cushy days when newspapers could count &#8220;casual browsers&#8221; as real readers and sell them to advertisers.  Newspapers had better get used to a world where links exist and can whisk readers away as quickly as they bring them.  Those who don&#8217;t will learn that trying to recreate the past is a sure a path to an early grave.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cr-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" />We've been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/chrome-for-mac-starting-to-look-polished/">gushing for weeks</a> now about the latest Chromium builds for Mac. Every day, they seem to get better. The problem is that every day, several updates are released and you have to manually go to <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/">the site</a> and scroll down a long list to find the newest version to download. So we've made an application that allows you to easily ensure that you have the latest version at all times.

Our Mac Chromium Updater was built with the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/grosen">Greg Rosen</a>, who created a script to check your version of Chromium versus the latest build. Then one of our developers, <a href="http://twitter.com/hunt3131">Hunter</a>, created an Automator process so you don't have to deal with installing something like Wget on your machine. The end result is a simple app that you run and let it update Chromium for you. <strong><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/chromium-updater.zip">You can find it here</a></strong>.]]></description>

<p>For those who aren&#8217;t aware, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)">Chromium</a> is the open source project behind Google&#8217;s web browser, Chrome. While there are pre-release versions of regular Chrome available for Mac as well, the Chromium builds get updated much more frequently, and as such, are the closest to a working version of Chrome on the Mac. For example, latest versions of Chromium include <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/dont-look-now-but-flash-is-kind-of-working-on-chrome-for-mac/">Flash support</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/chrome-for-mac-continues-march-forward-with-bookmarks-and-better-flash/">bookmark support</a>. Overall, the project is coming along very nicely.</p>
<p>A couple quick notes about our app: First, when you run the app, depending on the speed of your connection, it may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to download the newest build of Chromium. So even if you don&#8217;t think the app is doing anything, let it run, and eventually you will see the latest build of Chromium open on your screen. Second, this has only been tested of OS X 10.5 Leopard, but Chromium will only run on Leopard, so there you go.</p>
<p>Enjoy. We&#8217;ve included a read me file in the zip with a few more obvious disclaimers and a note of who to email with problems.</p>

Hewitt also says he'll post screen shots and more detais on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6628568379">this</a> Facebook page for the iPhone app next week, and that he's looking forward to getting started on v. 3.1 tomorrow.

<blockquote><p>That means that shortly, we’ll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook’s site, the ability to “like” items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have video support for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly. And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s likely Apple will approve this app in short order. Not only are they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/15/phil-schiller-is-a-man-on-a-mission-to-save-the-app-store/">trying to avoid</a> high profile app problems, there&#8217;s also not very much in the Facebook app that they or AT&#038;T would take exception to.</p>

<em>This guest post was written by <strong>Alex Ahlund</strong>, founder of <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee</a>.</em>

 AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.

The following is a round-up of our top picks so far this year:]]></description>

<p><em>This guest post was written by <strong>Alex Ahlund</strong>, founder of <a href="http://www.appvee.com/">AppVee</a>.</em></p>
<p>We are just past of a year since the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/">App Store launched</a> and there are more than 60,000 applications released for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  When we wrote our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/31/a-look-at-some-of-the-best-iphone-apps-of-2008/">2008 year-end app wrap-up</a>, we had just surpassed the 10,000 app milestone.  In early June 2009, the store reached <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/40-million-iphones-and-ipod-touches-and-50000-apps/">50,000 apps</a>.  At present, we are looking at a staggering 300 new applications being released every single day.  How does the average iPhone user find the gems in this deluge?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process is entirely overwhelming for the average iPhone user.  The bulk of consumers use iTunes’ Top and front page listings.  Since placement on the top lists is derived entirely from unit sales, there is a disturbing skew towards the $.99 applications.  This not only discourages big developers from putting high budgets and serious resources towards development of really useful applications and games, but also does a disservice to us, as iPhone users.  If all we see are ninety-nine cent gimmicks and toys, how will we realize the true potential of our device?  Apple attempts to offset this with editor’s picks, but this simply isn’t enough to make sense of the App Store.</p>
<p>There are new third party services and tools coming onto the scene to help show how to best navigate the App Store.  AppVee has been doing in-depth reviews of applications since the launch of the App Store and will soon celebrate our one-year anniversary with nearly 1,000 video reviews of the top applications. We’re often asked if we are overwhelmed with the number of applications currently released and the number we are capable of covering.  The answer is no. 90% of apps currently out there are of no use to anyone.  There are a massive number of clones, one-off gimmicks, volumes of books and reference material, and a never-ending supply of uninteresting games.  So, we try to act as a filter for consumers, directing them to what is worth their time and money.</p>
<p>The following is a round-up of our top picks so far this year:</p>
<p><strong>Most practical</strong></p>

<p>19. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-redlaser">Redlaser</a></strong><br />
Extremely reluctant to include this on the list, but it does deserve a bottom slot.  Scan UPC codes for price comparisons on the go, but wait for an update for improved scanning and database.</p>

<p>20. <strong><a href="http://www.appvee.com/t/iphone-app-review-real-racing">Real Racing</a></strong><br />

As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.

It's a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It's probably something to do with being a geek.

Arrington's reply was both a confirmation and a warning: "<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you're fired."]]></description>

<p>As I typed the message to Arrington, I could barely contain my glee. For a few strange years, starting towards the end of my teens, I worked as a magician - making good money and impressing girls by turning card tricks at corporate dinners and in fancy restaurants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long story, but one strangely common among people who ended up working on or around the web. For some reason a youthful interest in magic often comes hand-in-hand with a career in technology. It&#8217;s probably something to do with being a geek.</p>
<p>Arrington&#8217;s reply was both a confirmation and a warning: &#8220;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/not-bullshit-penn-teller-lauching-new-product-at-techcrunch50/">Yes they are</a>. And if you write anything that stops them coming, you&#8217;re fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s official: Penn and Teller - the magicians&#8217; magicians - are coming to TechCrunch 50 next month. Your response to this news will probably depend on which part of the technology barrel you inhabit. For those scraping along at the bottom - the self-described &#8217;social media consultants&#8217;, the me-too-rip-off app builders, the spammers, the search engine optimisation goons, the MySpace child groomers - it might be one of confusion. I mean, what could a couple of Las Vegas magicians possibly know about launching a technology product?</p>
<p>But for anyone else: anyone who understands that technology can actually be an art form rather than just a way to fleece gullible punters, the pairing of tech and magic makes perfect sense. I mean, Penn and Teller at TechCrunch 50 is basically the physical manifestation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Arthur C Clarke&#8217;s third law</a>: &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clarke&#8217;s law, of course, was little more than a useful crutch; a maxim that - by his own admission - he bolted on to his previous two (<em>&#8220;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right.&#8221; / &#8220;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible&#8221;</em>) because he decided three was a better number.</p>
<p>Also, by likening the kind of super-advanced technologies he wrote about to &#8216;real&#8217; magic Clarke could avoid Jules Verne&#8217;s problem of having to explain how his wonderful inventions worked, only for actual innovation to prove him wrong a few years later. Clarke&#8217;s point was that contemporary readers couldn&#8217;t possibly understand how his future technologies worked, they just did. Like magic. No further explanation required.</p>
<p>But in fact Clarke&#8217;s basic premise - that, at a certain level, the line between magic and technology becomes invisible - is absolutely right, just maybe for different reasons than he described.  Speak to any decent magician - one who has read his <a href="http://www.lybrary.com/modern-magic-p-121.html">Professor Hoffman</a> or at least his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Wilsons-Complete-Course-Magic/dp/0894716239">Mark Wilson</a> - and he will tell you about the time he saw a trick (or &#8216;effect&#8217;) that absolutely blew his mind, despite knowing every one of the technical principles behind it.</p>
<p>The one that stands out for me was the time - I was maybe 14 years old - that I watched an American magician called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williamson_(magician)">David Williamson</a> instantly restore a piece of rope that he had previously cut in half, using his fingers as a pair of scissors. The cut and restored rope is an ancient classic of magic, and there&#8217;s really only one way to do it. And yet the way Williamson employed that method was so good - so mind-blowingly, knee-shakingly good - that it (literally) made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
<p>And so it should be with technology. I remember - just as vividly as I remember David Williamson&#8217;s rope trick - the first time I bought a laptop with WiFi. For ten minutes or more I carried that laptop around my house, up and down stairs; into different rooms; even into my back yard, streaming full-screen video from the BBC website as I went. Again, I knew exactly what was going on: there was the WiFi card jutting from the PCMCIA port and I&#8217;d just spent ten minutes configuring the wireless hub. And yet&#8230; the experience of watching full-screen video on my laptop, without wires, was as near to pure magic as watching that piece of rope mend itself two feet from my eyes.</p>
<p>The comparisons between really good uses of the principles of magic and really good uses of technology are so numerous that they could fill a book. In the 1930&#8217;s, Charles Hoffman caused a sensation with a small brass tea-kettle that could - on command - pour any drink or cocktail that the audience requested. Today my iPhone, with its 3G connection and iTunes, can do the same for any piece of music ever recorded. Which one is more magical to watch, really?</p>
<p>Or consider Criss Angel who, using some invisible - but quite basic - method is able to tell a woman on Las Vegas Boulevard the precise date she was born, or what she does for a living. With Google I can summon any fact ever recorded, from wherever I happen to be in the world. Again, which is more impressive? Certainly neither is made less magical by knowing, broadly, how it works. The brilliance lies in how well the method is hidden, and how powerful the effect is.</p>
<p>And so it is with every single brilliant piece of technology, or web app that has ever been created. From the cellphone, to the iPod; from webcams to the web to WiFi. From email to eBay to Twitter to Hotmail to Shazzam to GPS to Google Maps to the Kindle. Pick your favourite, and remember how you felt when you first used it. Now remember the best magic trick you ever saw. The feeling is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Like all good rules, this one works the other way around as well. Remember the exact opposite of the best magic trick you ever saw. Your boring uncle&#8217;s card trick - the one where, through the most convoluted of methods, probably involving dividing the pack into piles and counting slowly through them - he triumphantly, and boringly, turned over the card you chose. Remember how he made you feel: you probably didn&#8217;t know what bizzare mathematics or slight of hand genius lead him to your card, but neither did you care. If he were a real magician, he&#8217;d have found the card straight away. The only person he impressed was himself.</p>
<p>The same is true of the worst technology. I don&#8217;t care how technically sophisticated <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/15/putting-wolfram-alpha-to-the-test-not-super-impressed-but-here-are-50-invites/">Wolfram Alpha</a> is, or how many genius hours it took to build it - all I know is that it forced me to think too hard, and returned results that were of no use to man nor beast. The technological equivalent of a boring uncle; the method was more impressive than the effect, and so the hairs on the back of my neck remain unstood.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Penn and Teller.</p>
<p>Of all of the magicians working today, none more perfectly illustrates the rule that a magical effect must take precedence over technical brilliance. Their stage show is a spectacular of blood and gore and guns and showgirls and pyrotechnics - and yet for their signature piece, they clear all of that aside and perform the oldest and most widely-known effect in magic: the cups and balls.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen it before, of course. Three cups, three little balls. One by one the balls vanish and, one by one, they reappear under the cups. Then, by way of a kicker, the cups are lifted to reveal three limes, one under each. But there&#8217;s more! The cups are stacked and lifted one last time to reveal - a huge lemon. Four large pieces of fruit from under three cups: cue the applause.</p>
<p>But while every magician since the ancient Egyptians has finished there, Penn and Teller announce that they are going to do the trick one more time: this time using transparent cups. It&#8217;s amazing to watch: every single load, every single sleight and steal is laid bare. You see the moment they put the limes under the cups. You even see the lemon go in. But such is the brilliance of their execution, that you&#8217;re still left both baffled and blown away. The method becomes irrelevant, the effect is everything. The audience is on their feet.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s for that reason that I&#8217;m so delighted that Penn and Teller will be at Techcrunch 50. Not for what they&#8217;re launching - although from what I&#8217;ve heard, it&#8217;s going be pretty damn cool - but rather for what their appearance will hopefully remind anyone getting ready to launch a product, either at the event or at any time in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how clever your technology - if the effect doesn&#8217;t make the hairs on the back of your audience&#8217;s neck stand up, you need to keep working until it does. But if you do manage to build something even half as impressive as that lemon appearing under that plastic cup, then fame, fortune and a well-deserved standing ovation will be yours for the taking.</p>

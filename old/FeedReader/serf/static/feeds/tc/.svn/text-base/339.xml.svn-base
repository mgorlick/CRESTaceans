Nambu rejected those, as it is instead looking to sell. Now we know the price it's asking for: As of right now, they're seeking something between $80,000 and $100,000, three separate sources have told us.

Not surprisingly, all three are balking at that price. After all, the main reason Nambu is giving for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">folding Tr.im</a> is that it can't compete against Bit.ly when Twitter is actively promoting and using it as its default link shortener. Still, several other parties have reached out to us to say that they are interested in purchasing the service (though they did not appear to know the price tag).]]></description>

Still, several other parties have reached out to us to say that they are interested in purchasing the service (though they did not appear to know the price tag).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also hearing that Nambu Network is also considering shutting down its Nambu Twitter client, again citing Twitter&#8217;s preferential treatment of others. Currently, Nambu has a desktop and iPhone client.</p>
<p>Again, Tr.im URLs are going to be supported through the end of the year, so there is still plenty of time for a buyer to step in and scoop up the service. But with so much negativity surrounding it now, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">not great numbers</a> to begin with, will anyone?</p>

And now we can, thanks to pictures FriendFeed co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit">Paul Buchheit</a>, who <a href="http://friendfeed.com/paul/53c6e787/after-signing-papers">posted some pictures</a> of the two sides immediately after signing the deal in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>As you can see in these pictures, this deal was obviously important enough to Facebook that founder and CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> himself is there. Also pictured from Facebook is Vaughan Smith the director of corporate and business development. From FriendFeed, there were three of the co-founders Buchheit, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor">Bret Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-norris">Jim Norris</a> (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sanjeev-singh">Sanjeev Singh</a>, the fourth co-founder, was not there because he was getting on a plane, Buchheit notes).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not entirely sure that these pictures are of the deal signing, and not of the crew getting ready to play a game of pick-up basketball.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-71-212x200.png" width="212" height="200" />Everyone is obviously talking about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">Facebook/FriendFeed deal</a>, but everyone wants to know one key detail: How much did Facebook pay? Now we know: Facebook paid nearly $50 million when you add the $15 million it paid in cash with roughly $32.5 million (based on current valuations) in stock, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124993350820120361.html">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.

The stock is the key part of this deal. Its value is derived from the $6.5 billion common valuation after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/dst-to-buy-up-to-100-million-in-facebook-employee-stock/">a recent purchase of employee stock by the Russian investment group DST</a>. But what's really interesting about the stock is that these are options that vest over a set period of time ("several years," says WSJ), just as employees in the company get. Compared to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/25/parakey-did-investors-get-left-out-in-the-cold/">Parakey deal</a> in July 2007, in which the company got only cash and no stock, this seems like a pretty nice deal (assuming that Facebook's stock eventually pans out, of course).]]></description>

Now we know: Facebook paid nearly $50 million when you add the $15 million it paid in cash with roughly $32.5 million (based on current valuations) in stock, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124993350820120361.html">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The stock is the key part of this deal. Its value is derived from the $6.5 billion common valuation after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/dst-to-buy-up-to-100-million-in-facebook-employee-stock/">a recent purchase of employee stock by the Russian investment group DST</a>. But what&#8217;s really interesting about the stock is that these are options that vest over a set period of time (&#8221;several years,&#8221; says WSJ), just as employees in the company get. Compared to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/25/parakey-did-investors-get-left-out-in-the-cold/">Parakey deal</a> in July 2007, in which the company got only cash and no stock, this seems like a pretty nice deal (assuming that Facebook&#8217;s stock eventually pans out, of course).</p>
<p>Another interesting question about this is what <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/benchmark-capital">Benchmark Capital</a>, FriendFeed&#8217;s outside investor, got? It&#8217;s certainly possible that they&#8217;re taking the cash, while the FriendFeed employees take the stock. Benchmark invested a small part of the company&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/25/parakey-did-investors-get-left-out-in-the-cold/">$5 million round</a> in early 2008, so a $15 million exit would be pretty solid. But that&#8217;s all just speculation, it&#8217;s hard to know what Benchmark is getting for sure.</p>
<p>What else is interesting about this $50 million number is that it is 1/10th of what Facebook was apparently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/24/acquisition-dance-between-facebook-and-twitter-over-for-now/">willing to pay for Twitter late last year</a>. One big hold up in that deal was that Facebook was offering mostly stock, while Twitter wanted more cash (we heard roughly 20% would have been cash, with the rest coming in stock). Another big problem was that the stock Facebook was offering Twitter was apparently valued based on the ridiculous $15 billion valuation after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/liveblogging-the-facebook-press-conference/">Microsoft&#8217;s investment in October of 2007</a>. The $6.5 billion common stock valuation seems much more reasonable. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-takes-friendfeed-to-take-on-twitter/">Too bad</a> for Twitter.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tro-212x200.jpg" width="212" height="200" />

Something dramatic is going on between Zynga CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-pincus">Mark Pincus</a> and one of his old employees at Tribe.net, a company he cofounded in 2003. Pincus has obtained a temporary restraining order on <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/darren-mckeeman">Darren McKeeman</a>, formerly the IT Director at Tribe. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/02/tribe-gets-aquired-for-real-this-time/">Cisco acquired the company in 2007</a>.

Pinkus hasn't returned a request for comment, but the TRO was <a href="http://webaccess.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&#038;PRGNAME=ROA22&#038;ARGUMENTS=-ACCH09569682">filed</a> in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. 

McKeeman is prohibited from contacting Pincus at all, and must stay at least 50 yards away from him. He is also explicitly prohibited from any of the following to Pincus: "harass, attack, strike, threaten, assault (sexually or otherwise), hit, follow, stalk, destroy personal property, keep under surveillance or block movements." He is also restricted from purchasing guns or other firearms, and must sell or turn in any guns that he owns.]]></description>

<p>McKeeman&#8217;s only <a href="http://twitter.com/tjcrowley/status/3234326765">response</a> so far: <em>&#8220;Note to everyone: don&#8217;t lie in things you file in court! It will come back to haunt you! I&#8217;m quite happy these morons did lie, though.&#8221;</em></p>

This improved search functionality, which has been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/facebook-fixes-search-but-only-in-beta/">in testing</a> since June, gives users the ability to search through shared media and status updates from their friends and the Pages they follow.

The new search will be a breath of fresh air to anyone who has previously tried to search Facebook for, well, anything.

Just hours after we broke the news that Facebook had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">acquired</a> FriendFeed comes Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=115469877130">announcement</a> that it&#8217;s deploying its improved search product to everyone.  This improved search functionality, which has been <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/facebook-fixes-search-but-only-in-beta/">in testing</a> since June, gives users the ability to search through shared media and status updates from their friends and the Pages they follow.  And, perhaps more importantly, it lets users search through updates shared to &#8216;everyone&#8217;.  The gloves are off — Facebook is going after Twitter where it hurts.</p>
<p>The new search will be a breath of fresh air to anyone who has previously tried to search Facebook for, well, anything.  Under the old system, users had to browse through clunky categories to find their results, and there wasn&#8217;t a way to search though status updates or shared items at all.  Now you&#8217;ll be able to simply click through different tabs on the left side of the page to jump between different categories, much as your would jump between Friends List on the Facebook News Feed.  Another change is the way Facebook lets users &#8216;Search The Web&#8217; — now these results are shown as a filter, rather than on their own page.  And Facebook has also changed the search engine from Live.com to Bing, Microsoft&#8217;s rebranded and improved search engine.</p>
<p>These changes are especially important because search has long been one area where Facebook fell well behind Twitter.  Twitter Search has become an amazing tool for finding the most up-to-date information on a variety of topics, including everything from breaking news to movie reviews.  Facebook has slowly been making headway in this area by allowing users to share status updates with &#8216;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/facebook-brings-privacy-controls-to-publisher/">everyone</a>&#8216; (before that only your friends could see status updates).  But until now there hasn&#8217;t been an easy way to actually search through those public updates, which made the feature useless to most people.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll be able to jump over to Facebook search, click &#8221;Posts By Everyone&#8221; and use it in much the same way you would use Twitter Search.  You&#8217;ll see a list of matching updates from other users on Facebook, and a message at the top of the screen will update in real-time, alerting you as new updates containing your query come in.</p>
<p>For the time being it looks like Facebook isn&#8217;t promoting the feature too heavily — the &#8216;Posts By Everyone&#8217; is the last item in the list of search filters, and I suspect that Facebook has relatively few users who are sharing their updates with the public in the first place.  That will likely change soon though, as Facebook is planning to roll out a new suite of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/live-blog-the-facebook-privacy-conference-call/">privacy options</a> that will suggest that users begin sharing some of their data publicly.  </p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s 250+ million active users still dwarfs Twitter&#8217;s userbase, so even if only a small fraction of them begin using these new features, it won&#8217;t be hard for Facebook to become a serious contender in the real-time search race.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/benchmark-1.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot" alt="" />If you&#8217;re a partner at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/benchmark-capital">Benchmark Capital</a>, you&#8217;re having a very good day and celebrating two separate portfolio acquisitions. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s sort of like an unassisted triple play in baseball, it just doesn&#8217;t happen that often. Maybe that&#8217;s why the team looks so darn happy in their website picture. Partner <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-fenton">Peter Fenton</a> (labeled Rock Star in photo) led both deals.</p>
<p>The first is Friendfeed, which was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">acquired by Facebook</a> for an undisclosed sum. Benchmark was the sole venture capital investor in Friendfeed, which raised a $5 million in an early 2008.

<p>The second is the much larger deal - VMWare&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/08/10/vmware-acquires-springsource/">$400+ million acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.springsource.com/">Springsource</a>, an enterprise and web application development and management startup. Benchmark was the biggest investor in Springsource, which raised a total of <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/springsource">$15 million</a> in two rounds of financing prior to the acquisition.</p>
<p>These weren&#8217;t the only wins for Benchmark this year, either. They were also investors in Pure Digital (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/19/its-official-cisco-buys-pure-figital-flip-video-for-590-million/">acquired by Cisco for $590 million</a>) and OpenTable (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/21/opentable-has-a-healthy-ipo-shares-shoot-up-40-percent-market-cap-hits-600-million/">went public in May</a>).</p>
<p>Benchmark still holds the record for (probably) the best venture investment in history - they turned a $6.7 million investment in eBay in 1997 into $5 billion by 1999. Partner <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-gurley">Bill Gurley</a> talks about that deal and Benchmark in general in our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/19/the-matt-cohler-exit-interview/">video interview with him</a> last year.</p>

The deal closed at a $420 million valuation, with $362 million in cash and equity plus an assumption of approximately $58 million in unvested stocks and options. 

SpringSource is a notable proponent of "lean software," a concept that is gaining traction in the enterprise space as a means of accelerating the delivery of business applications in the cloud.  With the acquisition, VMWare and SpringSource will partner with goals of delivering a platform that allows clients to "more efficiently build, run and manage applications in both internal and external cloud architectures."

The deal closed at a $420 million valuation, with $362 million in cash and equity plus an assumption of approximately $58 million in unvested stocks and options. </p>
<p>SpringSource is a notable proponent of &#8220;lean software,&#8221; a concept that is gaining traction in the enterprise space as a means of accelerating the delivery of business applications in the cloud.  With the acquisition, VMWare and SpringSource will partner with goals of delivering a platform that allows clients to &#8220;more efficiently build, run and manage applications in both internal and external cloud architectures.&#8221;  </p>
<p>“VMware has led the modernization of datacenter infrastructures through innovative virtualization and cloud architectures, providing customers with cost savings, agility and choice,” said Rod Johnson, chief executive officer, SpringSource.  “The SpringSource team and community are committed to revolutionizing the way companies build, run and manage applications.  By combining forces, I’m confident that we’ll be able to deliver a set of truly remarkable solutions that dramatically simplify enterprise IT.” </p>
<p>The move comes shortly after a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-continues-losing-long-time-employees-to-vmware/" >small exodus</a> of talent from Google to VMWare.  It is also interesting to note that <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/benchmark-capital" >Benchmark Capital</a> is SpringSource&#8217;s largest investor, with Peter Fenton sitting on the company&#8217;s board of directors.  Benchmark is also an investor in FriendFeed, so the firm is likely enjoying a nice start to the week.  </p>

But what does it mean? Well despite the rhetoric of some that this is a minor deal because FriendFeed&#8217;s audience was small compared to that of its acquirer Facebook, or even Twitter, this deal should actually have some wide-reaching implications for the future of how many of us use the web socially.</p>
<p><strong>Talent And Features</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear, from what all <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/first-interview-after-acquisition-with-friendfeed-and-facebook/">involved parties are saying</a>, this was a talent acquisition. Facebook has no need to integrate the entire FriendFeed service into its site which has over 250 million users. Actually, it already has a FriendFeed, its News Feed. But as we&#8217;ve pointed out numerous times, Facebook&#8217;s News Feed was simply not as good as the social stream FriendFeed had created. So instead, what Facebook will do is integrate the best features of FriendFeed, with the help of the people who built them.</p>
<p>Actually, Facebook had already been basically doing that (whether on purpose or not), something which led me to write in my <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/12/you-will-be-using-friendfeed-in-the-future-but-it-may-be-called-facebook/#">very first post for TechCrunch</a> back in April (appropriately titled &#8220;You Will Be Using FriendFeed In The Future — But It May Be Called Facebook&#8221;) the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I think it’s FriendFeed that Facebook should be more closely following [rather than Twitter], given what it wants to do with its service. That’s especially true when even more information starts coming into the site by way of Facebook Connect. Twitter has exploded in popularity because it’s so simple — but it’s far too simple for everything that Facebook want to do. But FriendFeed seems to be morphing into exactly what Facebook wants to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that FriendFeed co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor">Bret Taylor</a> said that there had been talks between the two sides for a while, it would seem that Facebook understood that. The incredible speed at which FriendFeed was developing and deploying new features — features which Facebook should have — was too hard to ignore.</p>
<p><strong>Social Feeds</strong></p>
<p>And why any of this matters is that an improved News Feed is what Facebook needs to hold off the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/04/facebooks-response-to-twitter/">challenge</a> from the company that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/24/acquisition-dance-between-facebook-and-twitter-over-for-now/">once spurned it</a>, Twitter. Twitter is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/twitter-back-on-track-in-june-with-20-million-us-visitors/">still growing fast</a>, and its more-open nature is turning it into the social platform of choice, something which Facebook used to be.</p>
<p>Facebook has a great opportunity to be the web&#8217;s central hub thanks to its Facebook Connect product which not only allows users to sign into other sites with their Facebook IDs, but also brings data back into Facebook from all around the web. But as was evident after the last News Feed (and total site) redesign, it has been difficult for Facebook to figure out how to handle and best showcase all that social data coming into the site.</p>
<p>FriendFeed has been very good at that, albeit on a much smaller site. But it&#8217;s not like these FriendFeed guys are amateurs. Almost the entire team comes from Google, including co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit">Paul Buchheit</a> who was integral in the building of a little service known as Gmail.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of Gmail, this is pure speculation, but what if once the News Feed has been updated, if Facebook decides to use Buchheit and co.&#8217;s services to build a better messaging system? <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/the-new-myspace-mail-quietly-emerges-as-a-big-time-email-competitor/">MySpace just completely revamped</a> their system, and Facebook&#8217;s is pretty poor.</p>
<p>Of course, one could also argue that with a killer social stream, it may negate the need for a revamping of the email system. After all, FriendFeed does messaging very well right now with its combination of public and private comments and posting.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong></p>
<p>One aspect that is small but hugely important for the social stream, is filtering. Facebook had been getting better at it with various groups you could place contacts into to sort your stream, but FriendFeed was again, much better.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a perfect example. When one of your contacts on Facebook posts and item that you don&#8217;t care to see, you have the option to hide it. But if they&#8217;re constantly posting the same type of item, you can only either hide them each time, or hide that entire user. With FriendFeed there were several more options, including hiding elements from just a certain source, as well as automatically unhiding items if a friend had &#8220;liked&#8221; it.</p>
<p>I could go on; let&#8217;s just say FriendFeed&#8217;s method is much, much better.</p>
<p>And Twitter? Yeah, they badly need filters, pronto.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>Twitter Search has shown a glimpse of the power of being able to get at up-to-the-minute information in real-time. But again, FriendFeed does it better. Twitter search isn&#8217;t able to scan farther back then a couple weeks, but FriendFeed search scans the service&#8217;s entire history.</p>
<p>And FriendFeed search actually does update in real-time. This constant flow may annoy some users, but FriendFeed smartly implemented a system that pauses when you hover over one element. Twitter has been experimenting with real-time refreshing of search on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/twitter-unveils-a-live-updating-search-widget/">its new widget</a>, but the main search product still requires a manual refresh.</p>
<p>And Facebook search? Well, they finally rolled out <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-flips-the-switch-on-real-time-search-goes-after-twitter-where-it-hurts/">a revamp of it today</a>, after several weeks of testing. Previously, it was quite bad, scanning only static information. It&#8217;s better now, but still not at the level of FriendFeed search. Down the road, this acqusition should help that as well.</p>
<p><strong>The Open Debate</strong></p>
<p>But today&#8217;s acquisition also extends beyond that of Facebook&#8217;s services. A lot of current FriendFeed users are expressing displeasure with the move because they saw FriendFeed as a true bastion of hope for an open social stream versus Facebook&#8217;s closed method. While Facebook&#8217;s Chris Cox is saying the right things today about Facebook&#8217;s desire to be open, and there has been some progress, the process has been really slow. And plenty wonder if Facebook really <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/21/social-profiling/">wants to be open at all</a>.</p>
<p>The same people also see Twitter as more open, but still relatively closed use of the social stream, because its APIs are limited. FriendFeed, which recently launched a new version of <a href="http://friendfeed.com/api/">its own APIs</a> had the respect of the developer community for their openness, if nothing else. Now, a lot of users are upset at the prospects of a very open service being lured behind a wall.</p>
<p><strong>The Twitter Paradox</strong></p>
<p>Something else that is interesting in all of this is just how reliant FriendFeed has been on Twitter as a source of its data. We saw this first hand the other day when Twitter went down (and cut off its APIs) due to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/serious-twitter-outage-ongoing/">the DDoS attacks</a>. FriendFeed was much, much quieter without the tweets coming in.</p>
<p>Facebook has applications that allow you to import your tweets to update your status as well, but as we&#8217;ve seen, neither side seems to particularly care when those applications just <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/twitters-popular-facebook-app-has-been-broken-or-exploited-for-days/">stop working</a> for weeks, or <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/new-twitter-cross-posts-to-facebook-have-users-bewildered/">break</a>.</p>
<p>The FriendFeed team clearly saw the value of Twitter in their ecosystem, but with Facebook, it&#8217;s wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if the emphasis will be less on Twitter, and more on Facebook&#8217;s own status updates. But if Facebook is smart, they may let FriendFeed do to its News Feed exactly what it did to the FriendFeed stream, which is open it up to all those Twitter updates.</p>
<p>The reason is that while Twitter itself remains important in that scenario, it&#8217;s possible that with Facebook&#8217;s 250 million plus users, a lot of the conversation (meaning comments) will start to take place on Facebook (just as it did on FriendFeed). This will slowly devalue Twitter over time as users realized they can have these conversations and cut out the middle man. This happened to a smaller extent when FriendFeed added the ability to post your own messages right to FriendFeed.</p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is a very smart move by Facebook to bolster its product, especially as it relates to the real-time web. One thing it does not do however, is make Facebook simpler. I&#8217;d still argue that Twitter has an inherent advantage over Facebook because it is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/28/keep-it-simple-stupid/">so much simpler to use</a>, resulting in a much lower barrier to entry. But naturally, with the complication comes a lot more data, and data is ultimately be the key for a larger battle for the web, so it&#8217;s a trade-off.</p>
<p>Where this leaves FriendFeed as a service is still up in the air. The team has said FriendFeed will continue to run as-is for the time being, but made no promises about the future. Cox&#8217;s comments seem to indicate that FriendFeed will be a sort of farm system for the big league Facebook, which I&#8217;m sure will piss off plenty of FriendFeed devotees.</p>
<p>Eventually, one way or another, it&#8217;s hard to see FriendFeed as it stands now, continuing on. Facebook will begin to take up too much of the FriendFeeders&#8217; time, and it will languish. It&#8217;s sad, but that&#8217;s the web. Not every service can flourish. There simply aren&#8217;t enough users with enough time to use all of them.</p>
<p>So this move was also smart in a long-term sense by FriendFeed because it ensures the awesome technology it has fostered with FriendFeed will continue on, and could one day reach a billion people.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, the Facebook/Twitter battle just got a lot more interesting. And those are always fun to watch.</p>

Cox and Taylor won't talk deal terms or even if the deal was stock, cash or a mix (likely all stock or mostly stock).

But we had a chance to talk with Friendfeed cofounder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor">Bret Taylor</a> (pictured right) and Facebook VP Products <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-cox">Chris Cox</a> a few minutes ago to discuss the deal and the product integration plans going forward.</p>
<p><big><strong>On How the Deal Happened</strong></big></p>
<p>Cox and Taylor won&#8217;t talk deal terms or even if the deal was stock, cash or a mix (likely all stock or mostly stock). Friendfeed has raised just $5 million in an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/25/friendfeed-raises-5-million-now-open-to-everyone/">early 2008 financing</a>, and is backed by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/benchmark-capital">Benchmark Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Taylor said &#8220;<em>this is an 11th hour deal,&#8221; </em>(sounds like it was finalized last week and there was <a href="http://friendfeed.com/tudor/bea1de58/aftermath">quite a party</a>) but that the two companies have been talking for some time. <em>&#8220;Things heated up in the last couple of weeks,&#8221;</em> he said, after the two were on a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/10/crunchup-live-the-real-time-moment/">panel together</a> at the Real Time CrunchUp on July 10.<br />
<big><strong><br />
Product Integration</strong></big></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve heard from one source that, like the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/19/breaking-facebook-has-acquired-parakey/">2007 Parakey acquisition</a>, the deal is largely a talent acquisition by Facebook, and less about the Friendfeed product. Friendfeed has 12 employees, and all but one are engineers.</p>
<p>Taylor and Cox say that the Friendfeed product will live on independently, and eventually Friendfeed will be merged into Facebook. But the Friendfeed team is not being kept whole. Some employees will now report to Cox, others to engineering head <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-shroepfer">Mike Schroepfer</a>. In my opinion that means, long term, the Friendfeed product itself is unlikely to be a big priority.</p>
<p>But Facebook is clearly excited about Friendfeed&#8217;s ability to innovate and launch new products. Taylor said <em>&#8220;The basic idea is that Facebook doesn&#8217;t want to disrupt the product&#8230;they&#8217;ll take a lot of ideas that work well on Friendfeed and see how they apply to Facebook, and over time they&#8217;ll look at how to integrate the products.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>He also said that Friendfeed and Facebook agree on a few main philosophical points around openness. <em>&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s focus on Facebook Connect and openness is also a central tenet of Friendfeed. Some of our ideas on Friendfeed can really accelerate Facebook&#8217;s product plans.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Cox agreed, noting that Facebook is focused on being a platform and a service, and not just a destination site. <em>&#8220;Friendfeed&#8217;s core values, portability and aggregation of content created everywhere, will happen at an accelerated pace at Facebook.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Note that translations are rough, I took notes and I usually can&#8217;t read my own writing. </p>
<p>Friendfeed will move out of their Mountain View <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendfeed">offices</a> and join Facebook at their Palo Alto headquarters shortly, Taylor said.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/friendfeed-facebook-215x83.png" width="215" height="83" /><a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> has acquired <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>, we've learned.  We're gathering details now.

At this point details on the acquisition are still very sparse, but it's clearly a good match.  Over the last year or so, Facebook has "<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/09/facebook-activates-like-button-friendfeed-tires-of-sincere-flattery/">borrowed</a>" quite a few features that FriendFeed popularized, including the 'Like' feature and an emphasis on real-time news updates.

Obviously Facebook has already built out some of FriendFeed's functionality so there is some overlap, but there are still numerous ways FriendFeed beats out Facebook's News Feed setup.  One of these is the way stories are 'floated' to the top as new users comment on them.  And FriendFeed's system is truly real-time, unlike Facebook's feed which users have to manually refresh.

<p>Obviously Facebook has already built out some of FriendFeed&#8217;s functionality so there is some overlap, but there are still numerous ways FriendFeed beats out Facebook&#8217;s News Feed setup.

And FriendFeed&#8217;s system is truly real-time, unlike Facebook&#8217;s feed which users have to manually refresh.</p>
<p>But the biggest win here for Facebook is the FriendFeed team, which includes an all-star cast of ex-Googlers.  Perhaps best known of these is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit">Paul Buchheit</a>, who is responsible for creating Gmail, pioneering some of Google&#8217;s early (and incredibly lucrative) advertising products, and coining Google&#8217;s &#8220;Don’t be evil&#8221; motto.  Other ex-Googler co-founders include <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor">Bret Taylor</a>, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-norris">Jim Norris</a>, and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sanjeev-singh">Sanjeev Singh</a>.</p>
<p>And so begins the next step in Facebook&#8217;s assault on Twitter.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Be sure to check out our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/first-interview-after-acquisition-with-friendfeed-and-facebook/">interview</a> with Facebook VP Products Chris Cox and FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor, where they share their thoughts on the future of FriendFeed and its integration into Facebook.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>:<br />
FriendFeed has just <a href="http://blog.friendfeed.com/2009/08/friendfeed-accepts-facebook-friend.html">posted</a> a note to their blog confirming the announcement.  FriendFeed&#8217;s Bret Taylor writes that the site will continue operating for the time being, but that the company is still &#8220;figuring out its longer-term plans for the product&#8221;.  Likewise, the API will continue to function for the time being.</p>
<p><b>Update 2 :</b>: Facebook has just issued the following press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>PALO ALTO, CALIF.—August 10, 2009—Facebook today announced that it has agreed to acquire FriendFeed, the innovative service for sharing online.  As part of the agreement, all FriendFeed employees will join Facebook and FriendFeed’s four founders will hold senior roles on Facebook’s engineering and product teams.</p>
<p>“Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends,” said Bret Taylor, a FriendFeed co-founder and, previously, the group product manager who launched Google Maps. “We can’t wait to join the team and bring many of the innovations we’ve developed at FriendFeed to Facebook’s 250 million users around the world.” </p>
<p>“As we spent time with Mark and his leadership team, we were impressed by the open, creative culture they’ve built and their desire to have us contribute to it,” said Paul Buchheit, another FriendFeed co-founder. Buchheit, the Google engineer behind Gmail and the originator of Google’s “Don’t be evil” motto, added, “It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebook’s engineers are about creating simple, ground-breaking ways for people to share, and we are extremely excited to join such a like-minded group.”</p>
<p>Taylor and Buchheit founded FriendFeed along with Jim Norris and Sanjeev Singh in October 2007 after all four played key roles at Google for products like Gmail and Google Maps. At FriendFeed, they’ve brought together a world-class team of engineers and designers.  </p>
<p>“Since I first tried FriendFeed, I’ve admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO.  &#8220;As this shows, our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use.&#8221;</p>
<p>FriendFeed is based in Mountain View, Calif. and has 12 employees.  FriendFeed.com will continue to operate normally for the time being as the teams determine the longer term plans for the product.  </p>
<p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not released. </p></blockquote>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-42-137x200.png" width="137" height="200" />Yahoo has been active in the domain buying and selling space the past few months. Today, it was revealed to be the buyer of OMG.com, which sold last week for $80,000, according to <a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2009/08/10/yahoo-buys-omg-com-domain-name-for-80000/">Domain Name Wire</a>.

It's a great domain, and a really, really great price especially considering the image-centric <a href="http://tmz.com">TMZ.com</a>-rival it has called yes, <a href="http://omg.yahoo.com/">OMG</a>. (Note: I had no idea it actually existed, at least partially because it didn't have the omg.com domain — well, and also cause I'm not into celebrity gossip. But supposedly, <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/business/OMG-Yahoo-Dishes-More-Trash-Than-TMZ.html">it's big</a>.)

Of course, Yahoo has a history of obtaining good domain names and doing nothing or next to nothing with them. It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/17/yahoo-is-now-resorting-to-selling-killer-domain-names-on-the-cheap/">sold contests.com</a> in June for $380,000 after sitting on it for many years. It also <a href="http://www.hosting-domeny.org/2009/04/27/yahoo-sells-wpcom-to-wordpress/">sold WP.com</a> to WordPress parent Automattic in April of this year.]]></description>

<p>Of course, Yahoo has a history of obtaining good domain names and doing nothing or next to nothing with them. It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/17/yahoo-is-now-resorting-to-selling-killer-domain-names-on-the-cheap/">sold contests.com</a> in June for $380,000 after sitting on it for many years. It also <a href="http://www.hosting-domeny.org/2009/04/27/yahoo-sells-wpcom-to-wordpress/">sold WP.com</a> to WordPress parent Automattic in April of this year.</p>
<p>Given the numbers for recent sales, it does seem like Yahoo scooped OMG.com for a bargain basement price. As we said, it sold contests.com for $380,000, which also seemed cheap at the time when you compare it to something like candy.com, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/05/candycom-sells-for-a-sweet-3-million/">sold for $3 million in June</a>. And in February, toys.com sold for $5.1 million.</p>
<p>Sure, &#8220;OMG&#8221; is not even really a word, but it has become a common phrase in pop culture and would seem to be worth more than $80K in a world where candy.com sells for $3M — especially since it&#8217;s only 3 letters.</p>

Correct me if I'm wrong. So, we begin:

I swore I'd never wear them. We called them the <a HREF="http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/07/24/the-horror-the-horror-vibrams-fivefingers-of-suck/">Five Fingers of Suck</a> a few years ago and I was sure they were crazy. Friends, I'm here to tell you I was wrong. And I'm sorry.

Here's my story: I ran a marathon a few years ago. I got <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a> and couldn't run after the marathon. I worked through that inflammation, but by the time I was ready to run again I had gained thirty pounds. Wham. Shin-splints. So I was a fat former runner with leg problems. The prognosis wasn't good.

So I tried a few things - the elliptical, weight training, losing some freaking weight - but the thing that saved me were these shoes.

And that's too bad, because while the idea wasn't a perfect solution, it would have at least saved many of the URL's shortened with Tr.im that are now scheduled to stop working by the end of the year. Bit.ly's idea behind 301works is essentially to let all of the URL-shorteners bulk-upload links every week, which would then be stored on that service.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90997" title="9658510_1825cd3df4" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/9658510_1825cd3df4.jpg" alt="9658510_1825cd3df4" width="250" height="333" />Yesterday, upon hearing that the URL shortening service <a href="http://tr.im">Tr.im</a> was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">shutting down</a>, Bit.ly, the largest URL-shortener, stepped in with a proposal.

Tr.im parent <a href="http://www.nambu.com/">Nambu Networks</a> has rejected that ideas, and instead wants to sell the service, Bit.ly <a href="http://blog.bit.ly/post/159843105/301working">writes today</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s too bad, because while the idea wasn&#8217;t a perfect solution, it would have at least saved many of the URL&#8217;s shortened with Tr.im that are now scheduled to stop working by the end of the year. Bit.ly&#8217;s idea behind 301works is essentially to let all of the URL-shorteners bulk-upload links every week, which would then be stored on that service. &#8220;<em>We thought this was a useful idea — something that was inexpensive to execute and important for the industry</em>,&#8221; Bit.ly writes.</p>
<p>But when the idea was first proposed back in April, Tr.im and the other URL-shorteners turned it down initially. The main problem is thought to be privacy (some shortened-links are private on some services). But Bit.ly also thinks the reluctance to get on board may be related to one company ruling all of this, so it has reached out to some non-profits in the hope that they can take over.</p>
<p>The reason why Bit.ly wants this 301works service should be pretty clear. There&#8217;s a large <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090810/p14#a090810p14">uproar</a> right now following Tr.im&#8217;s demise on whether or not anyone should actually be using URL-shorteners just in case something like this happens. Even the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">all-powerful </a>Twitter-endorsed Bit.ly could go away some day, is the thought. But an archive of these links that is maintained outside any one service could help put people&#8217;s minds at ease.</p>
<p>Bit.ly says that using Amazon&#8217;s servers, it could have 301works up and running in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Again, this all sounds nice, but if the other guys don&#8217;t get on board, which Tr.im clearly isn&#8217;t ready to do, it&#8217;s kind of pointless. Bit.ly says that if someone does buy Tr.im and wants to use 301works, to let them know. Clearly, Bit.ly has no interest in buying the service.</p>

CIA and military satellites are still higher resolution, but it makes you wonder how fast the geo-information gap between governments and citizens is closing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also seen recently how the Untied States Holocaust Memorial Museum is using Google Earth to graphically document the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/google-steps-up-its-darfur-genocide-coverage-in-google-earth/">ongoing genocide in Darfur.</a>  It is becoming increasingly more difficult to hide from Google Earth, which makes us all Big Brother in a sense.  That&#8217;s a good thing (better us than a single government or corporation).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google Earth is only retrospective.  You can&#8217;t see what is happening across the globe right now.  Maybe one dayit will be closer to real time.  </p>

For all the <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090810/h0845">angst</a> around the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">demise of Tr.im</a>, the fact is that there are way too many URL shortening services in the world and inevitably more will fall by the wayside.  There simply is no need for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/analysis-which-url-shortening-service-should-you-use-17204">more than a dozen services</a> to make long URLs shorter (and that doesn't even count services such as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/supr-stumbles-out-of-beta-officially-enters-url-shortening-wars/">Su.pr</a> or the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/diggbar-changes-permanent-no-longer-a-short-url-service/">Diggbar</a> which incorporate a URL shortener as a feature).

Already, the market is consolidating around bit.ly, largely thanks to it being the official URL shortener adopted by Twitter (which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">switched</a> from competitor TinyURL back in May).  Currently, <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> makes up 79.6 percent of the short URLs on Twitter, according to <a href=" http://tweetmeme.com/about/statistics">stats</a> kept by Tweetmeme. It is followed by <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL </a>(with 13.75 percent), <a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> (2.47 percent), <a href="http://ow.ly/url/shorten-url">ow.ly</a> (2.26 percent), and FriendFeed's ff.im (1.92 percent). ]]></description>

<p>For all the <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090810/h0845">angst</a> around the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">demise of Tr.im</a>, the fact is that there are way too many URL shortening services in the world and inevitably more will fall by the wayside.  There simply is no need for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/analysis-which-url-shortening-service-should-you-use-17204">more than a dozen services</a> to make long URLs shorter (and that doesn&#8217;t even count services such as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/supr-stumbles-out-of-beta-officially-enters-url-shortening-wars/">Su.pr</a> or the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/diggbar-changes-permanent-no-longer-a-short-url-service/">Diggbar</a> which incorporate a URL shortener as a feature).</p>
<p>Already, the market is consolidating around bit.ly, largely thanks to it being the official URL shortener adopted by Twitter (which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">switched</a> from competitor TinyURL back in May).  Currently, <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> makes up 79.6 percent of the short URLs on Twitter, according to <a href=" http://tweetmeme.com/about/statistics">stats</a> kept by Tweetmeme. It is followed by <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL </a>(with 13.75 percent), <a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> (2.47 percent), <a href="http://ow.ly/url/shorten-url">ow.ly</a> (2.26 percent), and FriendFeed&#8217;s ff.im (1.92 percent). </p>
<p>On Friday, before it shut down, Tr.im was no. 4 on the list, even with ow.ly.  So when I say that Tr.im is not going to be missed I do not mean that it was not loved by some users. It was even moderately popular.  But as you can see from the market shares above, it is hard to compete against bit.ly since it is Twitter&#8217;s default URL shortener.  Twitter should just buy it already and put all the other ones out of their misery.  Until it does that, it is in Twitter&#8217;s interest to keep a few alternatives in the wings. If it ever chose to switch to another default service, that one would grow to 70 to 80 percent of all short links within a few months as well.  </p>
<p>In other words, if bit.ly ever slips on the innovation front, it can easily be replaced.  But bit.ly is more than a URL shortening service. All of those links hold valuable data.  Collecting that data plays into its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/bitlys-grand-plans-and-their-inevitable-clash-with-digg-bitly-now/">grander plans</a> to show users deep analytics and the most popular links being shared at any given time.  Tr.im didn&#8217;t have any such plans.  It was an afterthought of <a href="http://nambu.com/">Nambu</a>, whose main focus is to make a killer stream reader.  If making URLs short (and mining the resulting data) is not your main business, it is hard to compete against startups who do nothing else.</p>
<p>Many developers and others find <a href=" http://scobleizer.com/2009/08/10/twitters-platform-shortcomings/">Twitter&#8217;s favoritism maddening</a>, but that is how standards are created (right or wrong).  As for Tr.im users who are afraid they will lose their data or that all of their short links will be broken, bit.ly has <a href="http://blog.bit.ly/post/159843105/301working">offered</a> to create a short-link redirecting archive at <a href="http://www.301works.com/">301works</a>.  Nambu should take them up on the offer (but it won&#8217;t right now because it wants to sell tr.im and that data is valuable).</p>
<p>What happens to those links is really what we should be worried about.  Broken links mess up the Web.  All URL shortening services should make a directory of all of their short links available where anyone (especially search engines) can look up the underlying long link where each one redirects. Maybe this is 301works or some other non-profit repository, but having all of these non-standard short links proliferate will just create more problems down the road when other URL shorteners inevitably fail.  And fail they will, which is another reason for publishers to use their own custom URL shortener (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/its-awesm-create-a-powerful-custom-url-shortener-for-your-own-domain/">we use Awe.sm</a>) and always control their data.</p>

<p>The once-great feed reader, bought by IAC in February 2005 for around $10 million, has been on life support for a couple of years now. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/26/all-new-bloglines-launches-in-beta/">two year old beta site</a> with new features remains in beta and has never been launched on the main domain name.

<p>Repeated attempts to sell the service for next to nothing went nowhere. And recently, we&#8217;ve heard, IAC strongly considered simply shutting it down. The team ultimately decided not to, but they are clearly looking for a long term home for the project.</p>
<p>Competitor <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/newsgator-discontinues-online-rss-reader-points-to-google-reader/">Newsgator recently threw in the towel</a> and suggested users port their feeds over to Google Reader.</p>
<p>Something interesting needs to happen at Bloglines at a product level, or they will, inevitably, be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool">deadpooled</a>.</p>

<p>More than two years after buying advertising network <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-pays-6-billion-for-aquantive/">aQuantive for $6 billion</a>, Microsoft finally unloaded the digital advertising agency that came with that deal.  It sold <a href="http://www.razorfish.com/">Razorfish</a> to French advertising conglomerate Publicis Groupe for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=agZekSvwGGf8">$530 million</a> in a combination stock-and-cash transaction.  The price was 1.4 times Razorfish&#8217;s 2008 sales of $380 million.  </p>
<p>Microsoft has been <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090628/p10#a090628p10">shopping Razorfish around</a> all summer.  It was reportedly hoping to get $600 to $700 million, but the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">advertising recession</a> didn&#8217;t help.  Microsoft settled for a slight discount to that.  </p>
<p>But at least now Microsoft is out of the people-heavy ad agency business (Razorfish has 2,000 employees), and can concentrate more on its automated search and display ad platforms.  Razorfish remains one of Microsoft&#8217;s preferred ad agencies (it came up with the Bing ads).  And as part of the deal, Publicis agreed to purchase both search and display ads from Microsoft on behalf of its clients.  </p>
<p>Maybe that is where Microsoft will make up the difference between the $530 million and its original asking price.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/dell-logo-online-new.jpg" class="right"/>A source with knowledge of the situation tells us that Dell is launching (or at least announcing) a mobile phone in China in the next day or two. We are trying to verify the information and gather more details on the hardware and operating system now.</p>
<p>Our sources on new hardware coming out of Asia tend to be spot on (we broke the news of the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/07/15/kindle-20-coming-around-october-2008/">second and third generation Amazon Kindles</a>, the launch of the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/01/04/exclusive-new-palm-phone-to-have-slide-down-keyboard-large-touchscreen/">Palm Pre</a> and the existence of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/29/forget-the-palm-pre-theyve-got-a-second-device-coming-out-this-year-were-calling-it-the-mini-pre/">second Palm WebOS phone</a> and generally have good information on sales figures for iPhones, Kindles and other devices). But in this case the information we&#8217;ve received is extremely thin.</p>
<p>There have been reports of Dell launching a phone in the Chinese market in recent months, with rumors of the carrier partner being China Mobile in <a href="http://www.jlmpacificepoch.com/newsstories?id=145645_0_5_0_M">one case</a> and China Unicom in <a href="China Unicom">another</a>.</p>
<p>There is also wide speculation on the operating system, but we&#8217;re guessing it&#8217;s Android. Dell has also been working with Google on an Android-powered tablet computer in recent months. But in April Reuters had a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSTP9541020090414?pageNumber=1&#038;virtualBrandChannel=0">report</a> that Dell may be creating a proprietary operating system with China-based software maker Red Office.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve heard on the hardware: iPhone-like, touchscreen, no physical keyboard. that&#8217;s it for now. Keep an eye on the Dell China <a href="http://www.dell.com.cn/">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
We now get reports from China that China Mobile is about to release a Dell-branded Android phone called &#8220;Ophone mini3i&#8221; in the next days. More info <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/08/10/dell-calls-it-china-only-mobile-phone-ophone-mini3isupports-android/">over at MobileCrunch</a>.</p>

According to a <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/159369789/tr-im-r-i-p">blog post</a>, the reason behind the decision is Twitter&#8217;s decision to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">use bit.ly</a> for their URL shortening, as well as the cost for servers and development while there are many other solutions for URL shortening.</p>
<p>Nambu Networks will now focus its attention on Nambu for Mac OS and iPhone.</p>
<blockquote><p>tr.im did well for what it was, but, alas, it was not enough. We simply cannot find a way to justify continuing to work on it, or pay its network costs, which are not inconsequential. tr.im pushes (as I write this) a lot of redirects and URL creations per day, and this required significant development investment and server expansion to accommodate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nambu Network&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t specifically say how many URL&#8217;s have been shortened, but looking at Twitter, tr.im was quite popular. The URL&#8217;s already shortened with tr.im will not be affected, but all tr.im links will continue to redirect, and will do so until at least December 31, 2009.</p>
<p>tr.im has been added to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool/">Deadpool</a>.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/familyties.png" class="shot2"/>Since I joined TechCrunch I&#8217;ve seen more Twitter clones and derivatives then I&#8217;d care to remember, most of which haven&#8217;t really gone anywhere.  But there are a few gems that have managed to tackle markets that Twitter has, for whatever reason, ignored.  One of these is <a href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a>, the &#8220;Twitter for businesses&#8221; that won the top prize at last year&#8217;s TechCrunch50.  And in the last few days, it&#8217;s become increasingly clear to me that there&#8217;s another niche market just waiting for a Twitter-like service: Family.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I was talking to TechCrunch alum (and rockstar dev) <a href="http://henrywork.com/">Henry Work</a>, who told me he was thinking of setting up a Yammer account with the sole purpose of keeping in touch with his immediate family.  It&#8217;s a fantastic idea — Yammer allows for secure, private communication, offers an iPhone app, SMS support, and a web client, and is free for basic functionality.  Even better: the company has just comfirmed that it&#8217;s planning to offer Push notifications for its iPhone app in the near future, which would help cut back on SMS costs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to think of countless ways that a family-oriented Yammer group could come in handy, especially for families with children who are still in school.   Need someone to pick up the kids from baseball practice?  Send out a message and see if a spouse or older sibling can help, without having to wade through a game of phone tag.  Quickly send out reminders that you&#8217;re heading to Grandma&#8217;s house in the morning to make sure nobody sleeps in. And, of course, you can hold nightly polls to figure out what&#8217;s for dinner.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one hitch.  Yammer only accepts users with company Email addresses — you can&#8217;t just fill in your Gmail account and get started.  Anyone looking to use Yammer in this fashion would have to register their own domain name and create a new Email account for each family member.  In other words, it&#8217;s not something that the vast majority of the population is going to be doing any time soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are a handful of under-appreciated startups that have had this very idea, but a quick Google search for &#8220;Twitter for families&#8221; doesn&#8217;t reveal any obvious choices.  In fact, most of the relevant links are articles talking about people who actually <i>do </i> use Twitter itself to talk to their families.  I suppose that would work if you kept all of your tweets private and didn&#8217;t want to let anyone other than your family members follow you, but that doesn&#8217;t seem practical.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what we need:  a Yammer-like service that allows for easy signups (rather than use domains to restrict registrations, it could simply require approval from the family&#8217;s account admin).   Monetization could involve premium features (calendar reminders?) or perhaps a low monthly fee.  Given that it already has the technology, Yammer could obviously build something like this fairly quickly — they could even use it to further extend the <a href="http://www.geni.com">Geni</a> brand (Yammer was a Geni spin-off).  And if they don&#8217;t do it, someone else should.</p>

There is no shortage of controversy surrounding the company right now thanks largely to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/the-state-of-the-iphone-is-strong-very-strong/">hugely popular</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/how-i-learned-to-quit-the-iphone-and-love-google-voice/">hugely unpopular</a> aspects of the iPhone. But Jason Calacanis' post yesterday entitled "<a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/">The Case Against Apple-in Five Parts</a>" serves as a great springboard for bringing up a lot of it.

<strong>The Backstory</strong>

While my story with computers doesn't go back quite as far as Calacanis', our stories are pretty similar. He said that 6 years ago he made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year affair with Microsoft. I made the same switch 5 years ago after a roughly 15-year affair with Microsoft.

Regular readers may have heard this already, so forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but in the 1990s I loved Microsoft products and hated Apple stuff. I grew up on DOS, installed Windows For Workgroups because I thought it was cooler than regular Windows 3.1, bought Windows Bob, made my dad take me to the midnight launch of Windows 95, bought Windows 98 the day it came out, actually bought and used Windows ME, and bought Windows XP the day it came out. I could fill that timeline in with many other pro-Microsoft details, but let's just say I was hooked.]]></description>

<p><strong>The Backstory</strong></p>
<p>While my story with computers doesn&#8217;t go back quite as far as Calacanis&#8217;, our stories are pretty similar. He said that 6 years ago he made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year affair with Microsoft. I made the same switch 5 years ago after a roughly 15-year affair with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regular readers may have heard this already, so forgive me if I&#8217;m repeating myself, but in the 1990s I loved Microsoft products and hated Apple stuff. I grew up on DOS, installed Windows For Workgroups because I thought it was cooler than regular Windows 3.1, bought Windows Bob, made my dad take me to the midnight launch of Windows 95, bought Windows 98 the day it came out, actually bought and used Windows ME, and bought Windows XP the day it came out. I could fill that timeline in with many other pro-Microsoft details, but let&#8217;s just say I was hooked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I loved Microsoft because I didn&#8217;t know anything else. Our high school was Mac-only. I hated it. The systems were slow, I hated their UI and I just found them generally frustrating to work with. And I used them everyday for years. Throughout all of high school and college I only bought PCs even after many viruses and a few complete system failures.</p>
<p>So what changed? For me, two things. First, the iPod. Second, OS X.</p>
<p>After I finished college in 2004, I bought my first iPod. Prior to that I had been using several other MP3 players (one of which I got for free when I bought Windows XP). But I needed a new device with a lot of storage for my long drive out to California. Obviously, I had heard great things about the iPod, and despite its high price tag, I decided to get one.</p>
<p>The fact that it was so much better than every other MP3 player I had used to that point said nothing specifically about Apple&#8217;s other products, but it did plant the thought in my head that if Apple was able to make such a nice experience for its portable music players, maybe its computer experience had also evolved from the poor one I remembered from high school. Still, I was a broke just-out-of-college kid, and Macs were yes, expensive. So my curiosity remained a curiosity for the time-being.</p>
<p>But a few months later, I was living in LA and working in Hollywood. Everyone there was using Macs, and as such, I had to use one at my job. Less than a week into using one on a regular basis, I realized something: I liked OS X a lot. Since it was released after my time in high school, and I still generally avoided Macs in college, I hadn&#8217;t really ever used the OS before. But in Hollywood, I was forced to, and I really liked it.</p>
<p>If the iPod had planted the Apple seed in my head, using OS X watered it. The conclusion soon blossomed: Apple now made great products.</p>
<p>Within a couple of months I had bought my own Mac (the cheapest white MacBook I could find) to serve as a back up to my PC. A couple months after that I basically stopped using my PC. A couple months after that I shipped the PC home as a present for my dad. I have never bought another PC since. During that time, I have bought 5 Macs.</p>
<p><strong>The Product</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90880" title="2586298923_17cb4ce40f" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2586298923_17cb4ce40f.jpg" alt="2586298923_17cb4ce40f" width="275" height="324" /></strong>Okay, that is a lot of set up to get to an opening point, and one that is actually the most important point. I made the switch from the PC world to the Mac world because of one thing: I believed that Apple started making better products than the other guys.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple point, one that is certainly subjective, but I really believed it, and that&#8217;s why I switched. And it&#8217;s why I remain an Apple-user despite some of the headaches, which I&#8217;ll get to. If you make a great product, you can get away with a lot — which again, Apple has. But it is my belief that it will continue to, because at the end of the day all that really matters is the product.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s despite Calacanis&#8217; belief that there&#8217;s a brewing backlash against Apple. Sure, there is a small one among tech journalists and some in the mobile <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/fed-up-a-popular-mac-developer-quits-the-iphone/">developer community</a>. And I do believe it is warranted. But the fact remains that Apple&#8217;s business is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/22/economy-be-damned-apple-posts-its-best-second-quarter-earnings-ever/">stronger</a> than it has ever <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/apple-sold-twice-as-many-iphones-as-macs-last-quarter/">been</a>, and that&#8217;s because more people are Apple users — whether that be Mac computers, iPods or iPhones.</p>
<p>The easiest way to continue on at this point will be to look at and address each of Calacanis&#8217; 5 points.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices</strong></em></p>
<p>Calacanis argues that Apple should open iTunes to any MP3 players on the market. He says that if that occurred, other MP3 players not necessarily made by Apple would flourish. I think he has it backwards.</p>
<p>I actually think iTunes is <em>not</em> a great piece of software, and that Apple could do a much better job with it (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">iTunes 9 might help</a> out with that). And I believe Apple may actually know that, as I have heard whispers that they&#8217;ve been trying to completely revamp it for some time now, with no luck so far.</p>
<p>The key ingredient in the iTunes/iPod universe is the full ecosystem aspect of it. iTunes isn&#8217;t great for the straightforward managing of music, but it is brilliant for buying music through iTunes and having it sync automatically with your iPod (and now your iPhone).</p>
<p>Even if Apple opened iTunes up for use with other MP3 players, I have a hard time believing the market would flow towards other players. Having used quite a few of the MP3 players that are available in the U.S., I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that the iPod (all its different flavors) is still the best of breed. There may be better ones in Asian countries, but some of the features that Calacanis talks about like TV-tuners would not fly here. (This is something I&#8217;ll hit on again later when we get into the iPhone.)</p>
<p>But the key here is that with iTunes open to other MP3 players, Apple would have less control over the user experience, something which is very important to them. Adding non-Apple devices which Apple would have little or no control over from a hardware perspective would be a headache for them and in turn, for some users. It might be worth it if they made significant money from music sales on iTunes, but they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Sure, some people do not want or like that level of control, and there is somewhat of an argument that it is in some ways anti-competitive, but the majority of users of iPods benefit from the ease of use that a contained ecosystem provides.</p>
<p>And the bigger picture is that this really doesn&#8217;t matter that much anyway, because the iPod and all other MP3 players as we know them are currently in the process of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/the-ipod-as-we-know-it-is-dying/">a slow death</a>. And as devices connected to the web take over, eventually much of the media consumption and management on these devices will occur on the device itself.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90884" title="picture-34" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-34.png" alt="picture-34" width="299" height="266" />&#8220;<em>Apple’s iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking–wait for it–AT&amp;T’s monopoly in the ’70s and ’80s,</em>&#8221; Calacanis writes. On one hand that is a very interesting statement, in so much as it relates to AT&amp;T specifically. On the other, it&#8217;s pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree that Apple and AT&amp;T&#8217;s exclusive partnership is a problem. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">It&#8217;s a big problem</a>. And I think for both consumers and Apple it needs to end when the deal is up next year. But I believe that Apple realizes that too, and will open the device to other networks (or at least announce the intention to do so) at some point next year. It simply makes no sense not to. Not only is AT&amp;T performing poorly under the strain of so many iPhones, but for Apple to keep expanding its user base, it simply needs to be on other carriers in the U.S.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s all-too-easy to forget that the iPhone has absolutely changed the mobile landscape in the U.S. for the better. We complain about not being able to browse the web on AT&amp;T&#8217;s crappy network, but think back not even 5 years ago when the idea of browsing the mobile web at all, was absurd.</p>
<p>I remember being very excited to get the Motorola RAZR when it finally came to Verizon. I still have that phone; it&#8217;s laughable compared to just about every phone on the market right now. And a lot of that is thanks to the iPhone. I&#8217;m not saying there would not have been innovation without it, but I am saying that Apple&#8217;s product made its competitors get their heads out of their asses, and we&#8217;re starting to see the fruits of that with nice devices from Palm, RIM and some of the newer Android phones. Ones that don&#8217;t have to use the shitty carrier-built operating systems.</p>
<p>Yes, it sucks that the iPhone is tied to AT&amp;T right now. But my CDMA RAZR was tied to Verizon, and I was stuck using their hideous operating system which offered me next to nothing. My point is just that in some ways, many of us have been spoiled this past 2+ years with the iPhone. It&#8217;s easy to forget what it was like before it existed. Which is to say, awful.</p>
<p>And just to hop back to the Asian marketplace, which I mentioned earlier, it is true that they have had some amazing phones with amazing capabilities for a while. But the point is that here in America, the carriers had us completely under siege with horrible phones and even worse plans until very recently. When Apple cut its deal with AT&amp;T for the iPhone, the same deal we all now bitch about (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">maybe none more than me</a>), it changed the landscape — for the better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into Calacanis&#8217; two SIM card idea, which sounds nice, but would be a complicated nightmare that hardly anyone would pay for.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Draconian App Store policies that are, frankly, insulting</strong></em></p>
<p>I agree with a lot of this, and have expressed why <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/heres-how-iphone-app-store-ratings-work-hint-they-dont/">numerous times</a> in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">the past</a>. It is ridiculous that we can rent movies on our iPhones that have nudity and graphic violence, but can&#8217;t have apps that offer the same. Actually no, it&#8217;s not just ridiculous, it&#8217;s hypocritical. I understand why that was the case before there were parental controls, but now they&#8217;re in place and Apple is still banning <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/yep-iporn-is-here-for-the-iphone/">applications</a> that it has no business banning left and right when it offers movies with the same stuff.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s store and they can do what they want. And if they don&#8217;t want hardcore porn apps, that&#8217;s fine — they also don&#8217;t sell hardcore porn movies. They do sell plenty of rated-R movies though, yet restrict many apps that would obtain a similar (or possibly even lighter) rating.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90889" title="2370011973_35d89103d2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2370011973_35d89103d2.jpg" alt="2370011973_35d89103d2" width="300" height="285" />That being said, I think Calacanis&#8217; point about how ridiculous it would be if Microsoft approved every app for Windows is a bad one. It&#8217;s not like Apple restricts applications for OS X on its Macs; doing that would cause an uproar just like it would on Windows. But the mobile space is different because it&#8217;s so new when it comes to apps. Microsoft is going to restrict apps that can be on Windows Phones. They won&#8217;t be as strict as Apple, but they will still have restrictions, just as Android does.</p>
<p>The mobile app world is new and still evolving. A number of Apple&#8217;s App Store rejections are ridiculous. Hell, I cover a lot of them and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/apple-rejects-another-app-for-using-an-icon-that-looks-like-an-iphone/">say as much</a>. But I think it&#8217;s wrong to think that Apple is doing this with malicious intent. Based on a number of conversations I&#8217;ve had with people to varying degrees in the know about Apple&#8217;s App Store, I would argue that they simply were not ready for what it has become.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that when it launched, there were just a handful of people who would check every single app that was submitted. Undoubtedly, the team has expanded quite a bit since then, but it still <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/156413699/many-of-the-mercenary-testers-i-encountered-were">very much seems</a> like they have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/who-exactly-is-in-charge-of-the-app-store-anyone/">no comprehensive strategy</a> when it comes to app approvals and rejections. Many seem arbitrary, and at the whim of the reviewers, because I believe they are.</p>
<p>When Apple VP Phil Schiller <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">wrote to Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber</a> last week about one app rejection, his last line was the most telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple’s goals remain aligned with customers and developers — to create an innovative applications platform on the iPhone and iPod touch and to assist many developers in making as much great software as possible for the iPhone App Store. While we may not always be perfect in our execution of that goal, our efforts are always made with the best intentions, and if we err we intend to learn and quickly improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of that, I would change &#8220;if we err&#8221; to &#8220;when we err&#8221;, but it seems pretty clear that Schiller and Apple know there have been real problems with the system, and they&#8217;re attempting to correct them. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing a good enough job of that, but I have no doubt that is hard to change things on the fly with a entity that is exploding in popularity as quickly as the App Store is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an excuse for some of Apple&#8217;s poor decisions, but it is unfortunately, the reality.</p>
<p>Calacanis&#8217; solution is to give users the option to install unapproved apps as an option. That would just be a slightly easier way of jailbreaking your phone, something which is already extremely easy to do. The reason why Apple won&#8217;t do this is the same reason why it won&#8217;t open iTunes to other MP3 players. When it controls the ecosystem, it can ensure the customer experience. Something which, again, is very important to Apple.</p>
<p>That may not be what some people want to hear, but the fact is that it works well for the majority of users who have no idea about the app approval process.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90892" title="2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c.jpg" alt="2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c" width="250" height="375" />Again, this to me is just as much about the mobile landscape being a completely different one than the desktop landscape, even though they are merging. When the iPhone launched, the idea of a mobile browser was basically a joke. Sure, Opera may have been decent on Windows Mobile devices, but let&#8217;s be honest, hardly anyone was browsing the web on their phones.</p>
<p>With the iPhone, mobile web browsing has exploded. Would it be nice for Apple to let you use other browsers on your phone? Sure, but really, how much different is each mobile browser compared to another one? Some are faster at JavaScript, I guess, but all lack the bells and whistles that their desktop counterparts offer.</p>
<p>I wonder if what Calacanis is really getting at is that he wants a browser that can run Flash? I think we all want that, but Apple has decided that for whatever reason it is not going to do that. Maybe it&#8217;s waiting for the HTML 5 video capabilities to make Flash less necessary (which still seems a long ways off)? Maybe it really believes the performance is simply not up to par? Who knows. But even with another browser on the iPhone, Apple would still have to allow for plug-ins to be installed, which probably wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>As the mobile web and devices continue to mature, there undoubtedly will be a lot to be said for having other browsers on the phone. I just don&#8217;t see that as such a big issue right now.</p>
<p><em><strong>5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone</strong></em></p>
<p>I completely agree that this is ridiculous. And the fact that Google is now implementing a work-around by <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10305716-37.html">making Google Voice a web app</a> for the iPhone, shows that banning the native app is also pointless. But I believe this rejection had more to do with AT&amp;T — and certainly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/att-dont-blame-us-for-the-iphones-google-voice-ban/">more than they&#8217;re letting on</a>.</p>
<p>When Calacanis says, &#8220;<em>Or, just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they’ve BOUGHT AND PAID FOR.</em>&#8221; I would again point to that being AT&amp;T&#8217;s issue much more than Apple&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve seen that with the SlingPlayer app, which can only work over WiFi but not on AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G network because they&#8217;re concerned about the bandwidth it would use.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all paying near or over $100 a month to use the iPhone on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network. If they cannot handle the iPhone any longer — which I&#8217;ve made the argument that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">I don&#8217;t think they can</a> — then both Apple and AT&amp;T should agree to remove the exclusivity agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While Calacanis certainly has some valid points, I would argue that some of his points simply reinforce what makes Apple, Apple. By controlling the ecosystem surrounding their products, Apple ensures a great user experience for the majority of users.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s really the key point: The <em>majority</em> of users. We can bitch as much as we want about Apple&#8217;s shortcomings, but by and large the public couldn&#8217;t care less about any of it, nor do they even know about any of this stuff. Does my sister care that Apple rejected Google Voice? No, she&#8217;s never heard of Google Voice. As far as she knows, all is well in the Apple universe because she turns on her iPhone and boots up her Mac and they work, giving her an experience that she finds superior to competitors&#8217; products.</p>
<p>The fact remains that as long as the company continues pumping out high-quality products that offer this great user experience, people will buy them. Calacanis believes that cheap and stable products from Microsoft and Google will undercut Apple, but that seems to be the same thing that people have been saying for years about Apple&#8217;s products. Macs are too expensive, iPods are too expensive, the iPhone is too expensive — people are still buying them. And they&#8217;re doing so at or near record levels, which is stunning in this economy.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90887" title="698695902_cd1b9f4f01" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/698695902_cd1b9f4f01.jpg" alt="698695902_cd1b9f4f01" width="250" height="375" />He seems to be suggesting that the premium market will disappear. But again, if it hasn&#8217;t in this economic environment, I don&#8217;t see it happening. Cheap, stable and open sound great, and they are great, for some people. But others are fine with paying more for what they consider a superior experience, and they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>And while Calacanis may have spent $20,000 on Apple products over the years, everyone that is not Calacanis has spent billions upon billions more. Until those billions stop rolling in, Apple will generally stay on the same path. Despite some of the rhetoric, Apple is not a totalitarian state, it is very much a democracy. It&#8217;s just that in this democracy, people vote with their wallets.</p>
<p>None of that is to say that Apple shouldn&#8217;t fix any of its aforementioned problems. With regards to AT&amp;T and its App Store policies, it certainly needs to. But it&#8217;s humorously short-sighted to think that they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But Calacanis goes farther, &#8220;<em>Making great products does not absolve you from technology’s cardinal rule: Don’t be evil.</em>&#8221; That would seem to suggest that he believes Apple is making some of these mistakes with malicious intent. Instead, I would argue that the mistakes stem from the pursuit of making great products. They control the ecosystem because people left to their own devices would make the products less great.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something that will be hard for a lot of people to hear, let alone understand. But I do believe it&#8217;s at the core of what Calacanis thinks makes Apple &#8220;evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why much of this isn&#8217;t a case against Apple, it&#8217;s a case <em>for</em> Apple. Many of the problems Calacanis talks about simply aren&#8217;t seen as problems by Apple, and more importantly, by the public at large. Until that changes, there is no real risk to Apple.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that the only real risk to Apple goes back to the simple point: Great products. If Apple stops making products that are great, it will start to decline. If someone else comes along with a better product, Apple will decline. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>5 years ago, it was my belief that Apple offered a better product that got me to ditch my PC. And I&#8217;ll switch again from Apple if something better comes along. This isn&#8217;t some elaborate conspiracy in which Steve Jobs is tricking millions of people into buying his stuff against their will. They&#8217;re buying his stuff because it&#8217;s good. End of story.</p>

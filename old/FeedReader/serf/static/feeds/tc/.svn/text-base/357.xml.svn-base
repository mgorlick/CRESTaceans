The post notes that these changes  "mostly include clarifying changes and minor updates", but there is at least one change that has some significant implications: Facebook users are banned from "using their personal profiles for their own commercial gain", with selling status updates to advertisers explicitly being singled out as a violation.

This stands in stark contrast to Twitter, which permits (or at least, doesn't actively discourage) so-called "Sponsored Tweets", which typically include a link to an online store along with a tag indicating that a tweet was sponsored.  The idea behind such updates is that users can share products they like with their friends and make money in the process, but it's a system that can quickly devolve into a spam fest.  With plenty of services in this space that include <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/brands-beware-you-may-be-on-sucked-into-izeas-paid-shilling-without-your-knowledge/">Izea</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/23/be-a-magpie-is-payperpost-for-twitter/">Magpie</a>, the PayPerPost model is becoming disturbingly popular.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4561/4561v1-max-250x250.png" class="shot2"/>Today Facebook has posted a note to its <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=118305662130">blog</a> indicating that it&#8217;s proposing an update to its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities — one of the site&#8217;s documents that establishes user rights and Facebook&#8217;s Terms of Service.  The post notes that these changes  &#8220;mostly include clarifying changes and minor updates&#8221;, but there is at least one change that has some significant implications: Facebook users are banned from &#8220;using their personal profiles for their own commercial gain&#8221;, with selling status updates to advertisers explicitly being singled out as a violation.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to Twitter, which permits (or at least, doesn&#8217;t actively discourage) so-called &#8220;Sponsored Tweets&#8221;, which typically include a link to an online store along with a tag indicating that a tweet was sponsored.  The idea behind such updates is that users can share products they like with their friends and make money in the process, but it&#8217;s a system that can quickly devolve into a spam fest.  With plenty of services in this space that include <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/brands-beware-you-may-be-on-sucked-into-izeas-paid-shilling-without-your-knowledge/">Izea</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/23/be-a-magpie-is-payperpost-for-twitter/">Magpie</a>, the PayPerPost model is becoming disturbingly popular on Twitter.</p>
<p>Of course, Facebook offers <i>Pages</i> which do allow for commercially-sponsored updates.  But the distinction between the two types of profiles are quite clear, and I don&#8217;t object to status updates from celebrities endorsing a product nearly as much as I would if it came from one of my friends who became overly-greedy.</p>
<p>One other significant change comes in the way Facebook regards users who are accessing the site from countries that the US has an embargo against.  The current terms state that users &#8220;will not use Facebook if you are located in a country embargoed by the U.S., or are on the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s list of Specially Designated Nationals.&#8221;  Facebook has now revised this to only apply to commercial activities, with the new proposed terms stating: </p>
<blockquote><p>We strive to create a global community with consistent standards for everyone, but we also strive to respect local laws. The following provisions apply to users outside the United States:<br />
1.	You consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.<br />
2.	If you are located in a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s list of Specially Designated Nationals you will not engage in commercial activities on Facebook (such as advertising or payments) or operate a Platform application or website. </p></blockquote>
<p>These changes are only proposals so far (Facebook users now have a week to submit their thoughts on the changes), but I&#8217;d be surprised if there are many objections.</p>
<p>One sidenote: Facebook is running its Governance section so that users can have their say regarding how the documents are written.  But there&#8217;s apparently no way to see the diffs between each document — in other words, you have to put them side by side and look for any difference in wording manually.  To make this even more frustrating, Facebook is arbitrarily inserting rules in the middle of numbered lists rather than adding new rules to the end.  Fortunately Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt says that the company will look into addressing these issues, so they may well be resolved the next time the site proposes a change in its TOS.</p>

<p>It is not often that a company waits ten years to take its first venture capital.  <a href="http://www.mywebgrocer.com/">MyWebGrocer</a>, which was founded in 1999, raised $13 million today in a series A investment from the <a href="http://www.stripesgroup.com/">Stripes Group</a>, a private equity firm in New York City.  This is definitely a late-stage growth round.  The company is already profitable.  Stripes is a private equity firm that likes to invest later-stage growth companies, and there was even an investment bank involved (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/montgomery-co">Montgomery &#038; Co.</a>) as an adviser to MyWebGrocer.  Guess who wants to lead any eventual IPO?</p>
<p>MyWebGrocer, which is based in Vermont, was initially funded by its founder Rich Tarrant and then from operations as it grew to power the websites of 5,000 grocery stores across the country.  Now it is looking to expand more aggressively, which is why it raised the series A.</p>
<p>MyWebGrocer runs websites on behalf of grocery chains and sells advertising to consumer packaged goods companies across all the sites, which collectively have a reach of 4 million shoppers.  MyWebGrocer makes money both from fees paid by the grocery chains and a rev-share on the online ads.  The Website scan be configured to simply show the week&#8217;s specials or include full online shopping modules, with the grocery store itself handling the delivery.  In that sense it is a white-label version of <a href="http://www.peapod.com/">Peapod</a>, but with a highly-targeted ad network attached.</p>
<p>The grocery industry might be a niche, but it is a very large one.  And its is an industry that is seemingly willing to outsource its Website operations to companies like MyWebGrocer.</p>

But not only is he, but upon hearing the proposal (based on Ben Mezrich's "The Accidental Billionaires"), Sorkin claims it's the <em>fastest</em> he's "ever said 'yes' to anything."

He claims he was just 3 pages into the 14-page proposal about the book, when he knew he would do it. But it gets better. "If you asked my why I said 'yes', I'm not sure that I can give you a clear answer," Sorkin says.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-91341" title="picture-182" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-182.png" alt="picture-182" width="227" height="221" />I&#8217;m still finding it a little hard to believe that Aaron Sorkin (he of <em>A Few Good Men</em>, he of <em>The West Wing</em>) is writing the screenplay for the upcoming Facebook movie. But not only is he, but upon hearing the proposal (based on Ben Mezrich&#8217;s &#8220;The Accidental Billionaires&#8221;), Sorkin claims it&#8217;s the <em>fastest</em> he&#8217;s &#8220;ever said &#8216;yes&#8217; to anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He claims he was just 3 pages into the 14-page proposal about the book, when he knew he would do it. But it gets better. &#8220;If you asked my why I said &#8216;yes&#8217;, I&#8217;m not sure that I can give you a clear answer,&#8221; Sorkin says.</p>
<p>Also crazy is that David Fincher (he of <em>Seven</em>, he of <em>Fight Club</em>) is still said to be <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10271662-36.html">in talks</a> to direct it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read Sorkin&#8217;s first stab at the screenplay, and it&#8217;s pretty good, entirely too long (it would be about a 2 hour and 45 minute epic if it were shot as-is), but pretty good. Could a movie about <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and crew actually be decent? It&#8217;s starting to look possible. &#8220;I&#8217;m having a lot of fun with it,&#8221; Sorkin concludes.</p>
<p>The video below is from the site <a href="http://makingof.com/filming_now/media/the-social-network/aaron-sorkin-on-the-social-network/86/290">MakingOf</a>. As a side note, we love Sorkin because he wrote the words that inspired our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/best-comment-ever/">best comment ever</a>.</p>

Today, just days after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">shutting down Tr.im</a> and saying all support would cease at the end of the year, killing all the links shortened with the service, they have <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/160697842/tr-im-resurrected">reversed course</a>. "<em>Nambu will keep tr.im operating going forward, indefinitely, while we continue to consider our options in regards to tr.im’s future.</em>"

The company cites the massive outpouring of pleas not to shut down the service as the reason behind the move. But here's what we think is really going on. By shutting down the service and announcing that they would be completely dead in a few months, Nambu was ensuring that no one would use it. The problem with this is that they're also trying to sell Tr.im, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/nambu-wants-80k-100k-for-trim-considers-shutting-down-its-twitter-client/">for between $80,000 and $100,000</a>, we've heard from multiple sources.

<p>The company cites the massive outpouring of pleas not to shut down the service as the reason behind the move. But here&#8217;s what we think is really going on. By shutting down the service and announcing that they would be completely dead in a few months, Nambu was ensuring that no one would use it. The problem with this is that they&#8217;re also trying to sell Tr.im, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/nambu-wants-80k-100k-for-trim-considers-shutting-down-its-twitter-client/">for between $80,000 and $100,000</a>, we&#8217;ve heard from multiple sources. But everyone is balking at those prices. And with a non-working service, Nambu had absolutely no leverage.</p>
<p>So, the service is back and will operate &#8220;indefinitely&#8221; which is code for &#8220;until we can offload the site.&#8221; As they say in point number four on their blog post, &#8220;This was not a public-relations stunt. At all.&#8221; Sure, but it was an awful business decision — one that had to be reversed for any hope of a reasonable sale for them.</p>
<p>In their post today, they also make it very clear that they still blame Twitter for showing favoritism (Twitter uses Bit.ly as its default shortener), which led to the rash decision to shut off the service. We&#8217;ve also heard they were considering doing the same thing to their Twitter client over the same issue.</p>
<p>Nambu also notes that it won&#8217;t just offload the site to anyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>We too want to see tr.im live on, but feel we can only transition it to another party committed to ensuring the links are not highjacked in any way. A contract for sale to an unknown group or individual simply cannot guarantee that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This somewhat explains the multiple emails we&#8217;ve gotten from interested parties saying that Nambu is simply not responding to their inquiries about the sale. But a lot of these parties are reputable, so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what is going on over at Nambu. Perhaps they just didn&#8217;t want to engage some of these offers until the service was back on, and they had some leverage.</p>

Does Google's search results page feel a little more crowded to you?  The ads which used to run down along the right-hand edge of the page are now shifted over to the left, as if to declare, "Hey, look at us!"  Maybe this will increase the number of times ads are clicked on.  They are certainly more noticeable. 

The ads now seem like they are now grouped together with the organic results, whereas before they were shunted off to the side (a legacy of the early days of Google when the purity of organic results was protected as much as possible from being sullied by dirty ads).  In fact, on my screen the ads take center stage, with a thin line down the middle forming the slimmest barrier separating them from the natural results.   I wonder if this design change has something to do with the popularity of wider screens.  But the line and central placement of the ads also conveniently draw the eye.  ]]></description>

Take <a HREF="http://www.racevine.com/">Racevine</a> for example. This service allows you to search for and review races.

Want to know if the Wharf to Wharf run is worth racing? <a HREF="http://www.racevine.com/events/santa-cruz-ca/wharf-to-wharf">It&#8217;s there.</a> The New York Marathon? <a HREF="http://www.racevine.com/events/new-york-city-ny/ing-new-york-city-marathon">Bango.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/reviews-2_jpg.jpg"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/reviews-2_jpg-630x527.jpg" alt="reviews-2_jpg" title="reviews-2_jpg" width="630" height="527" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91307" /></a><br />
The real value here is in the search system. Say you&#8217;re bored and want to find a race in Ohio. <a hREF="http://www.racevine.com/events/columbus-oh/outer-limits-triathlon-and-duathlon">Bingo.</a> Right there. Sadly, there aren&#8217;t enough reviews on the site for the review portion to be much use just yet but that can change.<br />
<img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/race-2_jpg-630x434.jpg" alt="race-2_jpg" title="race-2_jpg" width="630" height="434" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91308" /><br />
Does the world need this service? Sure. Maybe you&#8217;re working on a PR or you want to do a 10K. Maybe you&#8217;re a big old lard butt like me and need to ease back into racing. Maybe you&#8217;re trying to find something close to the bar you frequent. The service is valuable in that respect. What it needs, I think, is a way to sign up for the races right online or a <a HREF="http://active.com">a connection to services like Active.com</a>. However, for boy and girl racers of all stripes it&#8217;s nice to see everything all in one place.<br />
<img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/scaledsearch-2_jpg.jpg" alt="scaledsearch-2_jpg" title="scaledsearch-2_jpg" width="630" height="391" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91309" /><br />
My real question is whether races <i>need</i> reviews. I know I show up to a race and just run it. I rarely pay attention to much else. It&#8217;s not quite a situation in which I&#8217;m paying much attention to the logistics or announcements. I think the adrenaline involved may just cancel out a lot of the qualitative judgements the racers may have, resulting in a bunch of fairly sparse reviews. Thoughts?</p>

The outage last week, which was caused by a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/oooh-dramatic-twitter-gets-ddosed/">DDOS attack</a>, started at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/serious-twitter-outage-ongoing/">around 6 am</a> California time on Friday and went <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/twitter-outage-moves-into-day-2/">through</a> the weekend. And even when Twitter had periodic uptime, third party apps were still shut down.

As usual, we provide a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/08/twitter-is-down-15-alternative-things-to-do/">handy list</a> of things to do while fretting about Twitter.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It&#8217;s back! Third party apps are still down, though. They always take the hard hit. And Twitter is calling this an &#8220;attack&#8221; - <em>&#8220;Update (12:17p): We’re back up and analyzing the traffic data to determine the nature of this attack.&#8221;</em></p>

These days, more and more books have accompanying Websites and smart authors even try to attract readers online before the book is even published.  Sometimes they even try to enlist those potential readers into contributing to the book (for free).  Brooklyn food writers <a href="http://twitter.com/amandahesser">Amanda Hesser</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/merrillstubbs">Merrill Stubbs</a> are crowdsourcing their next cookbook on a site that just launched in private beta called <a href="http://food52.com/">Food52</a> (it will open up on September 15, but you can sign up now for an invite at the site).  Hesser is a food critic for the New York Times and an author of several cookbooks (including <em>Cooking For Mr. Latte</em>, <em>The Cook And The Gardener</em>, and the upcoming <em>New York Times Cookbook</em>).  Stubbs is a freelance food writer and recipe tester.

The Food52 project will result in its own cookbook to be published by the <a href="http://theharperstudio.com/">Harper Studio</a> (which is also publishing the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/02/gary-vay%E2%80%A2ner%E2%80%A2chuk-turns-his-internet-celebrity-into-a-seven-figure-book-deal/">Gary Vaynerchuk ten-book library</a>).  Each recipe in the book will come from the Food52 community.   "We want it to be a cooking site where the users feel that they have a voice," Hesser tells me in her first interview about the project.

The site and the book will appeal to anyone who ever wanted to write their own cookbook but never had the time.  But it won't be a free-for-all.  Hesser and Stubbs will make editorial decisions with give-and-take from the site's members.  To guide the community, every week two themes will be presented which will act as a call for recipes. This week's themes (they are really assignments) are "Your Best Grilled Pork Recipe" and "Your Best Watermelon Recipe."  Anyone can submit their favorite recipes, along with photos or videos.  Then Hesser and Stubbs select the most promising ones, test them, and choose the best two for each theme.  They present these back to the Food52 members, who get to vote which one will make it into the cookbook.]]></description>

<p>These days, more and more books have accompanying Websites and smart authors even try to attract readers online before the book is even published.

Stubbs is a freelance food writer and recipe tester.</p>

<p>The Food52 project will result in its own cookbook to be published by the <a href="http://theharperstudio.com/">Harper Studio</a> (which is also publishing the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/02/gary-vay%E2%80%A2ner%E2%80%A2chuk-turns-his-internet-celebrity-into-a-seven-figure-book-deal/">Gary Vaynerchuk ten-book library</a>).  Each recipe in the book will come from the Food52 community.   &#8220;We want it to be a cooking site where the users feel that they have a voice,&#8221; Hesser tells me in her first interview about the project.</p>
<p>The site and the book will appeal to anyone who ever wanted to write their own cookbook but never had the time.  But it won&#8217;t be a free-for-all.  Hesser and Stubbs will make editorial decisions with give-and-take from the site&#8217;s members.  To guide the community, every week two themes will be presented which will act as a call for recipes. This week&#8217;s themes (they are really assignments) are &#8220;Your Best Grilled Pork Recipe&#8221; and &#8220;Your Best Watermelon Recipe.&#8221;  Anyone can submit their favorite recipes, along with photos or videos.  Then Hesser and Stubbs select the most promising ones, test them, and choose the best two for each theme.  They present these back to the Food52 members, who get to vote which one will make it into the cookbook.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a huge tradition of community cookbooks, but none of them are user vetted,&#8221; says Hesser.  Users can take part in creating the cookbook by submitting their own recipes and helping to edit the submissions through comments, ratings, and votes.  (Recipes can be flagged if someone tries to pass one off as their own that is actually from another cookbook).  Anybody who submits a recipe selected as one of the two finalist recipes each week will get a free copy of the book along with cookware tailored to their recipe.</p>
<p>The iterative process should bring hardcore foodies and fans of the authors coming back every week.  By the end of the 52 weeks, Hesser and Stubbs will not only have the recipes for their cookbook, but also a built-in and built-up audience already sold on the book.  It won&#8217;t be just a cookbook, it will be an artifact of their participation.  </p>
<p>The site itself is designed less to be a comprehensive cooking site than a highly curated one. In addition to the contests, there are editors&#8217; picks.  You can browse by recipes (organized both by category and most recent) or by cooks (contest winners, most active, and &#8220;cooks we admire&#8221;).  Of course, there is also a blog on the site written by Hesser and Stubbs, although that is not front and center and the first entry is about the shoes they wear while cooking.  Not terribly appetizing. </p>
<p>Beyond the first book, Hesser and Stubbs hope to make Food52 into a food destination site.  &#8220;Hopefully we will do more books,&#8221; says Hesser, &#8220;this is a starting point for gathering our community.&#8221;  Food52 is owned and operated by Hesser and Stubbs through a company they co-founded called Burnt Toast, LLC funded with proceeds from the book advance.   With any luck, the site will be worth more than the book.</p>

It depends on which king you’re talking about. As it stands, the iPod Touch is a whole different beast because of the App Store. What Microsoft has done with the Zune HD is nothing short of spectacular, but who is it really competing with? My BlackBerry can play videos and show me pictures taken on a recent trip. The HTC Hero and/or myTouch 3G can stream music from the likes of last.fm or Slacker. I can download MP3s from my iPhone. Everything the Zune HD does, I’ve been able to do with a slew of different devices that I already own. 

You see, the features that the Zune team has been touting don’t interest me much. I don’t really care to see an artist’s bio, their pictures or anything of that nature. Sure, the modified IE browser is nice and works great, but I want to know how deeply integrated the Zune HD is going to be with other Microsoft devices like the Xbox 360. I don’t need to fork over extra cash for an HD dock to stream 720p content onto my TV. I can already do that through my Xbox 360, FiOS and whatever content is stored on my NAS. Tell me what the plans are for the next six months. Tell me when the damn thing is actually going to launch. ]]></description>

Well, we know what it means now thanks to GM's CEO Fritz Henderson and it's somewhat impressive - and a tad dubious. GM is claiming that under the new EPA guidelines, the Chevy Volt will hit 230 MPG. The Volt would be the first car to ever earn a triple digit number.

Take a look at the current high-mileage kings and that 230 MPG rating really sinks in. The EPA handed the Prius a 51 MPG city ranking and the Insight a 41 MPG. The EPA says that the Ford Fusion hybrid can get 41 in the city and the Camary Hybrid 40 MPG in the city.

It's an international standard, it works just fine in every media player, and other universally-accepted formats are in place for the album artwork, lyrics, and what have you.

Sounds like you're ready for a new, unified format that no one has ever heard of and, if introduced five or six years ago, might have been revolutionary!

Universal, Sony, Warner, and EMI are all throwing their weight behind the CMX format, soon to be the laughing stock of the internet.Oh, did I mention that Apple, who makes like 200% of the MP3 makers in the USA, is making their own competing format, which pretty much guarantees that CMX will only be usable by things like Windows Media Player?]]></description>

An enterprising soul has tonight re-created the pivotal Hitler scene from the movie <em>Downfall</em>, but done so with subtitles explaining why Hilter is so mad that Facebook has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">acquired FriendFeed</a>.</p>
<p>This meme seems be done for just about everything on the web these days, but this one is particularly good because it&#8217;s full of good insider-y references. And it closely echoes some of the actual backlash against the news today which played out on FriendFeed.</p>
<p>Among the choice lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;It was a complete talent grab.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I even remember what it was like before Robert Scoble got here!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I used FriendFeed to argue about Obama and talk about health care, and to like tons of pictures from NASA that were awesome, not to spend my time posting pictures of bacon and talking about mangoes!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Of all the companies, they went with Facebook. They could&#8217;ve been acquired by Google and I would&#8217;ve been happy for them. Or even Twitter: That I could understand. But Facebook?! What the hell?!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we still have Plurk.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

It&#8217;s not clear at all if this would be a desktop app or an iPhone app, but it is said to be something that consolidates your various social networking activity from around the web into one place.</p>
<p>Is Apple planning a FriendFeed-killer after Facebook has already <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-takes-friendfeed-to-take-on-twitter/">essentially</a> killed FriendFeed? That would certainly give the team a good reason to sell, if they caught wind of that. But who knows, it could be anything, or it could very well be nothing. Hopefully we all know by now how rumors, especially Apple rumors, work.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Apple has in store, if there are social elements added to iTunes, it will be a big move for the company. Right now, they basically have absolutely no social strategy beyond a bit of Facebook and Flickr integration in iPhoto. And yes, there are plenty of apps that use Facebook Connect, but that has basically nothing to do with Apple itself.</p>

And that&#8217;s exactly what he did tonight, quietly launching a new service he&#8217;s developed called <a href="http://a.tinythread.com/">a tiny thread</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is simple, take tweets and thread them together to form conversations, adding context. This works by using the a tiny thread site to both start new conversation threads, and add your comments to old ones. After authenticating via OAuth, your comment is then sent back to Twitter, with a link back to the a tiny thread conversation page.</p>
<p>The site&#8217;s look is sparse (not entirely unlike early Delicious), but it&#8217;s very easy to follow conversations. You can see a good example thread <a href="http://a.tinythread.com/47rJUoE6cN">here</a>. Right now, the threads only go one level deep, so it actually very much resembles a FriendFeed comment section. FriendFeed, was of course just <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">bought today by Facebook</a>, and its future is uncertain.</p>
<p>Other sites have attempted to thread tweets together in the past, but the results vary because of things like retweets that either break threads or add too much noise. Right now, it appears you can only add to these a tiny thread conversations on the site itself, so it works pretty well. But when you send the tweet back to Twitter, it just reads, &#8220;I joined a thread: is this thing on?&#8221; followed by a link to a tiny thread. It might be more interesting if it said what you actually said in the thread, enticing people to click on the link to read the full context.</p>
<p>It would seem that Schachter, who has been <a href="http://twitter.com/joshu">tweeting</a> out links to this for about the past hour or so, did this on his own time, rather than his Google 20% time. Again, it&#8217;s extremely simple, but kind of interesting — especially in a post-FriendFeed acquisition world.</p>

New startup <a href="http://rxvantage.com/">RXVantage</a> is releasing a really smart SaaS product into a huge market - drug and medical device marketing.

Selling stuff to doctors is really big business - <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050001;jsessionid=AAC71DD2C9686100B174B2C0A403594E">$60+ billion a year</a> in the U.S. alone is spent annually in marketing to physicians by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. 175,000 reps visit offices and hospitals 110 million times per year to pitch their wares.

Today, pharma reps drop by offices in person just to schedule an office meeting with the physician down the road. They often do sample drops of medications and do a little pitching while the doctor signs for them. The average drop meeting lasts 22 seconds, for which a rep might wait up to 2 hours.

Top prescribers are visited by more than 100 reps per week, and meetings are scheduled as much as a year in advance.

Enter RXVantage.

<p>New startup <a href="http://rxvantage.com/">RXVantage</a> is releasing a really smart SaaS product into a huge market - drug and medical device marketing.</p>
<p>Selling stuff to doctors is really big business - <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050001;jsessionid=AAC71DD2C9686100B174B2C0A403594E">$60+ billion a year</a> in the U.S. alone is spent annually in marketing to physicians by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. 175,000 reps visit offices and hospitals 110 million times per year to pitch their wares.</p>
<p>Today, pharma reps drop by offices in person just to schedule an office meeting with the physician down the road. They often do sample drops of medications and do a little pitching while the doctor signs for them. The average drop meeting lasts 22 seconds, for which a rep might wait up to 2 hours.</p>
<p>Top prescribers are visited by more than 100 reps per week, and meetings are scheduled as much as a year in advance.</p>
<p>Enter RXVantage.</p>
<p>RXVantage is &#8220;Open Table for doctors&#8221; - it&#8217;s web based scheduling software that doctors and pharma/medical device companies use to calendar those visits, manage appointments, etc. It&#8217;s free for all parties to use, and premium features are available to the marketers if they choose.</p>
<p>The company is just preparing to launch nationwide but has had a 2 year closed beta in Rhode Island and Massachusetts with 450 doctors and 400 reps from 75 different pharma companies. The results - 94% of the doctors pitched started using the system, and the average rep reported 4-5 more appointments per month. </p>
<p>The premium version of the software, which is $25/month/rep, allows those reps to get alerts on canceled appointments (and an opportunity to fill it), targeting of relevant doctors and other features. </p>
<p>The company has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/rxvantage">$1 million</a> to date and is currently raising a second round of financing.</p>

Usually this results in something that&#8217;s either boring, weird looking (because of formatting issues), or just plain ugly.  <a href="http://www.jobspice.com">JobSpice</a>, a new startup that&#8217;s launching tonight, is looking to help users build web-friendly resumes that are as good looking as they are easy to customize.</p>
<p>JobSpice comes with a good pedigree: it is part of the latest batch of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded startups, and is co-founded by Andrew McCollum — a Facebook co-founder who served as the social network&#8217;s original designer.</p>
<p>Of course, there are already plenty of ways to build your resume — aside from Word, there are a number of online services that will do it for a price, though founders McCollum and Dane Hurtubise say that these generally can be pricey, going for upwards of $100. </p>
<p>In contrast, JobSpice is free, and it goes a long way toward making resumes visually appealing with a minimum amount of effort.  To do this, the site takes advantage of the naturally structured formatting of resumes and optimizes it for the web.  JobSpice uses CSS to style the resumes it generates, which means you can totally rework the appearance of your resume with a minimal amount of effort (and experienced web designers will be able to tweak their resumes to their hearts&#8217; content).  </p>
<p>At launch JobSpice only has around ten designs available, but it&#8217;s allowing users and graphic designers to submit their own designs to the library, which will then be shared with everyone.  For now all of these designs will remain free, through the company hasn&#8217;t ruled out offering premium designs at some point in the future.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/junelin2.png"/></p>
<p>Because of the modular design of each resume built by the service, JobSpice makes it easy to customize resumes for each person you send them to.  Simply check off which sections you&#8217;d like to include in your resume depending on what an employer is interested in, and the site will generate a unique URL for that version of the resume.  You can also easily export your resume to PDF.</p>
<p>To monetize, JobSpice has a few strategies in mind.  In the short term, they&#8217;re going to offer premium features like custom domains.  Further down the line, the company is hoping to use its service to streamline the hiring process, allowing employers to more effectively search through candidates and to help candidates find jobs.  Given that there are obviously some very established sites in this space like <a href="http://www.monster.com">Monster</a> and <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">CareerBuilder</a> this is likely going to be quite challenging, though there is certainly still plenty of room for improvement on these.</p>

Okay, I'm not even sure if that's really true about sharks. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's not. But still, it is true about search engines, in that they have to keep innovating and updating, if for nothing else to stay ahead of spammers. Google, as the king of search engines, obviously has been doing that constantly throughout the years. Some of the changes are noticeable, but most are subtle tweaks on a rolling basis.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-91187" title="2906514471_01fd1a7549" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2906514471_01fd1a7549.jpg" alt="2906514471_01fd1a7549" width="300" height="400" />Search Engines are like sharks: If they stop moving, they die.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not even sure if that&#8217;s really true about sharks. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s not. But still, it is true about search engines, in that they have to keep innovating and updating, if for nothing else to stay ahead of spammers. Google, as the king of search engines, obviously has been doing that constantly throughout the years. Some of the changes are noticeable, but most are subtle tweaks on a rolling basis.</p>
<p>But today, the company has begun testing a new engine for its search product that&#8217;s a big enough change that it felt compelled to <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/08/help-test-some-next-generation.html">let the world know about it</a>. Codenamed &#8220;Caffeine&#8221;, it promises to &#8220;push the envelope on size, indexing speed, accuracy, comprehensiveness and other dimensions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The test, available here: <a href="http://www2.sandbox.google.com/">http://www2.sandbox.google.com</a>/, really doesn&#8217;t look any different at first glance. And Google notes as much, saying that these changes are primarily under the hood. When you hear that, most people will probably assume this means speed in showing results.</p>
<p>So is it any faster? It&#8217;s hard to tell. Most results on Google are already so fast, that shaving a nanosecond here or there hardly seems to matter. By Google&#8217;s own counter (which show up along the top of every Google result page next to the number of results), the results are mixed. Sometimes Caffeine wins, sometimes regular old Google wins.</p>
<p>But reading Google&#8217;s statement, it seems that by &#8220;indexing speed&#8221; they may mean the speed at which they index pages behind the scenes, putting them in the results. It&#8217;s difficult to test that immediately, it seems like something you may start to notice over time as content comes in faster.</p>
<p>One thing I do notice is that across the board, Caffeine seems to have <em>more</em> results in its index than regular Google does. But it&#8217;s hard to tell if that really matters since most people never get to the end of the millions of results for items (and for most, in fact, you can&#8217;t).</p>
<p>In terms of actual results, they seem to be mostly the same. Doing the same search on each, a few results change positions, and some different ones appear, but it&#8217;s largely the same for the words I tested.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-cutts">Matt Cutts</a> worked on the project and <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/caffeine-update/">has a Q&amp;A</a> on his own blog that is interesting. Here&#8217;s my favorite part:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q</strong>: Is this Caffeine Update because of Company X or Y is doing Z?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Nope. I love competition in search and want lots of it, but this change has been in the works for months. I think the best way for Google to do well in search is to continue what we’ve done for the last decade or so: focus relentlessly on pushing our search quality forward. Nobody cares more about search than Google, and I don’t think we’ll ever stop trying to improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me that brings to mind two companies immediately: <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a>. Those are the two services doing the most interesting things around search right now that could potentially challenge Google. But the Google team claims it has been working on this project in secret for the past &#8220;several months,&#8221; so if you believe that, it stands to reason that this at least probably isn&#8217;t a direct response to Bing, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/bing-microsoft-prepares-for-war-with-a-revamped-search-engine-screenshots/">which is newer</a>.</p>
<p>And I like that answer. Too many companies focus on directly going after competitors by doing exactly what they&#8217;re doing, or attempting to. With Caffeine, it doesn&#8217;t appear Google is trying to do that, but instead is just trying to improve what it already does well. Of course, you can have that luxury when you&#8217;re the king.</p>
<p>I do wonder though if Google doesn&#8217;t do anything to change the appearance of its results, even if those changes are meaningless (adding more pictures, etc), if users won&#8217;t perceive that its rivals are out-maneuvering it. Still, better results cannot hurt, especially as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/which-search-engine-do-you-choose-in-the-blind-test/">some tests suggest</a> that the rivals may be catching up to Google in that regard.</p>
<p>Google is doing this public test now to get feedback from users, presumably before deploying it into wide release on google.com.</p>

Today they&#8217;ll be announcing that new CEO - former Agile Software CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jay-fulcher">Jay Fulcher</a> is now the CEO of Ooyala, and his first day on the job was today.</p>
<p>Founding CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bismarck-lepe">Bismarck Lepe</a> will remain on board as President of Product Strategy.</p>
<p>From my post last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>And now they’re considering the hire of a new CEO, we’ve confirmed. Bismarck Lepe, the current CEO, says he’s actually been looking for his replacement for the last year. This isn’t being driven by the venture investor, Sierra Ventures, he says. And in fact the founding team retains stock and board of directors voting control, making their consent a requirement of any CEO change. Lepe just feels as though he isn’t necessarily the guy to take the company to the next level, whatever that may be. So he’s retained a search firm to find someone better than him to run Ooyala.</p>
<p>The company is certainly doing well. We <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/ex-googlers-video-platform-ooyala-launches-powerful-analytics-software/">first covered them in late 2008</a> and they already had big name customers like National Geographic, TV Guide, AOL, and Warner Brothers. Today, Lepe says, they stream 250,000 - 350,000 hours of video a day through partners. One Michael Jackson <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/news/video-michael-jacksons-tragic-commercial-accident-2009157">video</a> last week racked up 70 million views in just 36 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/agile-software">Agile Sofware was acquired by Oracle</a> in 2007 for $495 million. Ooyala has taken just <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ooyala">$10 million</a> in funding to date.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video with the whole exec team, including Fulcher:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The press release:</p>
<p>Mountain View, CA&#8211; Ooyala, the leading provider of end-to-end video platform applications and services, today announced the appointment of Jay Fulcher as President &#038; Chief Executive Officer.  Former CEO and Co-Founder Bismarck Lepe, who led the company since its inception in early 2007, has been appointed President of Product Strategy, reporting to Fulcher.</p>
<p>Most recently, Fulcher served as President &#038; CEO of publicly held Agile Software, where he helped establish Agile as a market leader as it became the fastest growing product lifecycle management (PLM) company in the industry.  Fulcher led the sale of Agile to Oracle in late 2007.  Prior to Agile, Fulcher spent five years at PeopleSoft, where he led the transformation of PeopleSoft&#8217;s $1+ billion global services organization after being President of its $400 million Products Division. Prior to PeopleSoft, Fulcher held senior executive positions at Red Pepper Software and SAP.           </p>
<p>&#8220;Jay brings the necessary experience, track record and passion to lead our company.  We are extremely pleased to have attracted a CEO of Jay&#8217;s caliber to Ooyala,&#8221; said Bismarck Lepe, co-founder of Ooyala.  &#8220;He will have an immediate impact on our aggressive plans for growth.&#8221; </p>
<p>“I am really excited to be joining Ooyala during this period of hyper-growth,&#8221; said Jay Fulcher.  “Online video is an increasingly fast growing and strategic market, as traditional and new media channels finally converge.  Ooyala is well positioned to not only be the industry’s best video platform, but to provide the most personalized video experience to consumers and the most lucrative monetization platform to content owners.  Ooyala&#8217;s innovative products and customer-centric philosophy will enable the company to become the leader in this market.” Fulcher was attracted to Ooyala because of its focus on developing game-changing technology and the impact IP-based video will have on the future. &#8220;IP-based video is now a powerful reality and with that comes opportunities to better target advertising and deliver the content consumers want on their terms,&#8221; said Fulcher.</p>
<p>Ooyala already has over 500 global media and enterprise customers including Warner Brothers, Electronic Arts and Sybase. &#8220;Ooyala has been able to grow faster than any other Online Video Platform company because of its focus on technology, customer success and personalization,&#8221; added Fulcher.  &#8220;I am excited by the prospect of taking that early success and leveraging it to build a large, innovative and profitable business.&#8221; </p>
<p>Fulcher will join Ooyala and become a member of the Board of Directors, immediately.  </p>

<p>We&#8217;re also hearing that Nambu Network is also considering shutting down its Nambu Twitter client, again citing Twitter&#8217;s preferential treatment of others. Currently, Nambu has a desktop and iPhone client.</p>
<p>Again, Tr.im URLs are going to be supported through the end of the year, so there is still plenty of time for a buyer to step in and scoop up the service. But with so much negativity surrounding it now, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">not great numbers</a> to begin with, will anyone?</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the hoopla over the Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/the-cost-of-friendfeed-roughly-50-million-in-cash-and-stock/">$50 million</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">acquisition</a> of FriendFeed today, it&#8217;d be nice to see how it actually went down. And now we can, thanks to pictures FriendFeed co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit">Paul Buchheit</a>, who <a href="http://friendfeed.com/paul/53c6e787/after-signing-papers">posted some pictures</a> of the two sides immediately after signing the deal in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>As you can see in these pictures, this deal was obviously important enough to Facebook that founder and CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> himself is there. Also pictured from Facebook is Vaughan Smith the director of corporate and business development. From FriendFeed, there were three of the co-founders Buchheit, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor">Bret Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-norris">Jim Norris</a> (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sanjeev-singh">Sanjeev Singh</a>, the fourth co-founder, was not there because he was getting on a plane, Buchheit notes).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not entirely sure that these pictures are of the deal signing, and not of the crew getting ready to play a game of pick-up basketball.</p>

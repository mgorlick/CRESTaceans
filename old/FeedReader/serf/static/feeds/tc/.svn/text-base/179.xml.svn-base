				<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.ilike.com/mobile"><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/iphoneconcerts-136x200.png" width="136" height="200" /></a><a href="http://www.ilike.com">iLike</a> is launching a new iPhone application today that takes advantage of the iPhone 3.0 update's new features in some of the best ways that we've seen yet.  Dubbed "Local Concerts", the application lets you follow any artist you'd like and receive alerts whenever they announce that they're coming to a local venue.  For anyone who has ever tried to keep tabs on their local music scene, this is going to be a must-have.  You can grab the free app <a href="http://www.ilike.com/mobile">here</a>.

Using the app is pretty straightforward: it allows you to view all venues in your area, with concert listings for events that are going on in the near future or further down the line.  But it also includes a number of nifty features that the iPhone didn't previously support.  One of these is automated personalization — the application can look at your iPhone or iPod Touch's library, and determine which artists you should probably be following (though you're free to adjust the list on your own).  Once you've found a concert you'd like to attend, the app includes links to sites where you can purchase tickets. Whenever you've got an alert, you'll see a message pop up on your iPhone (much like an SMS message would) regardless of if you have the application open.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ilike.com/mobile"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/iphoneconcerts.png" class="shot2"/></a><a href="http://www.ilike.com">iLike</a> is launching a new iPhone application today that takes advantage of the iPhone 3.0 update&#8217;s new features in some of the best ways that we&#8217;ve seen yet.  Dubbed &#8220;Local Concerts&#8221;, the application lets you follow any artist you&#8217;d like and receive alerts whenever they announce that they&#8217;re coming to a local venue.  For anyone who has ever tried to keep tabs on their local music scene, this is going to be a must-have.  You can grab the free app <a href="http://www.ilike.com/mobile">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using the app is pretty straightforward: it allows you to view all venues in your area, with concert listings for events that are going on in the near future or further down the line.  But it also includes a number of nifty features that the iPhone didn&#8217;t previously support.  One of these is automated personalization — the application can look at your iPhone or iPod Touch&#8217;s library, and determine which artists you should probably be following (though you&#8217;re free to adjust the list on your own).  Once you&#8217;ve found a concert you&#8217;d like to attend, the app includes links to sites where you can purchase tickets. Whenever you&#8217;ve got an alert, you&#8217;ll see a message pop up on your iPhone (much like an SMS message would) regardless of if you have the application open.</p>
<p>Now, iLike has previously offered a more basic application on the iPhone but it was much more basic  — if you forgot to check the application manually, you wouldn&#8217;t know that your band was coming to town or their tickets were about to go on sale.  And the old app didn&#8217;t have the automatic artist detection, either.</p>
<p>The one thing I wish the app did have was an option to not only determine which artists you&#8217;d like to follow based on their appearance in your music library, but also to take into account the number of times you actually <i>listen</i> to those artists.  Obviously this would make things a bit more complicated, but there are plenty of artists I have on my iPhone simply because I feel obligated to fill the device&#8217;s storage space to the brim.  In any case, iLike&#8217;s current suggestion system will be plenty helpful for most people.  You can see it in action in the video embed below.</p>
<p>Alongside today&#8217;s launch, iLike is also releasing some of the initial stats for its custom iPhone app platform, which it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/13/ilike-launches-custom-iphone-apps-syndication-platform-to-help-artists-cast-a-wide-net/">launched</a> in May.  Over 250 artists have now used the platform to build their own applications, including Reba McEntire, Ingrid Michaelson, and Rusted Root.  The applications allow artists to build rich iPhone apps — including music, video, concert listings, and Twitter feeds — with a minimum of effort  It also taps into iLike&#8217;s syndication platform, which means content can be delivered to iLike&#8217;s 50 million fans easily.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rogen-178x200.jpg" width="178" height="200" />Let's start off by saying the clip below, taken from the new Adam Sandler movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201167/">Funny People</a>, is NSFW. So don't click it if you don't want to deal with a lot of swearing. About Facebook. 

And apologies for the atrocious quality. The studio said it would takes weeks or something to get all the signoffs for approval, so we just found the movie on the interwebs and used that. In other words, watch this ASAP before it's taken down, because it's highly unlikely the studio will simply put up a bunch of ads on YouTube and realize this is great viral marketing for the movie.

Yesterday I showed a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/myspace-tom-or-craigslist-craig-whos-tougher/">clip from the movie</a> showing Seth Rogen asking <em>“I wonder if Tom and Craig from Craigslist would ever get in a fight….Who’s tougher? Tom has more friends…Craig has weirder friends though. Craig has friends that are willing to do a lot more for cash, I’ll say that.”</em>

But the really shocking stuff were the <em>“f**ck Facebook, In the Face”</em> comments. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and, yes James Taylor all say it. Plus a lot of other quips, like MySpace cofounder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson">Tom Anderson</a> asking Sandler <em>"Do you actually use MySpace?"</em> Sandler replies <em>"No, no no. I f*ck girls, Tom. I don't have time for that."</em>

In all there's about 5 solid minutes of MySpace footage, most of which is shot in front of a big MySpace logo on the stage.]]></description>

<p>Interesting use of the brand. I&#8217;m not sure I would have gone in that direction.</p>
<p>See the movie though. Best one this summer so far after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/come-see-star-trek-on-opening-night-with-us-silicon-valley/">Star Trek</a>.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/koda.png" class="shot2" />Social recruitment service <a href="http://KODA.us">KODA.us</a> has just raised $1 million in funding from a group of private angel investors, bringing the total of seed investment injected into the San Francisco startup to $3 million. </p>
<p>KODA.us essentially wants to bring social networking and job recruiting together into one unified service, which it claims is &#8220;more professional than Facebook but more personal than LinkedIn&#8221;. </p>
<p>The idea is that by broadening the resume job seekers can submit or upload with personal attributes and relevant life experience, employers could get more extensive information about potential candidates based on profiles that are more personal than those usually found on traditional recruitment sites. On the other hand, KODA wants to give employers themselves the opportunity to portray job openings within the context of organizational branding, so that potential job candidates can get a feel of the corporate culture within companies before actually applying.</p>
<p>The site has only been in beta for two months after being in the making for the past two years. Jeff Berger, Co-Founder and CEO of KODA explains why he thinks traditional job boards are not cutting it anymore:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Using a job board is like searching for a needle in a haystack.  KODA gives you more needles, less haystack, and we’ve developed proprietary technology that facilitates a smoother recruitment process for both candidates and employers.” </p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure online job boards are that unsatisfactory at all, and this isn&#8217;t the first service to try and marry social networking with online recruiting. So far, I haven&#8217;t seen too many of those ventures get any significant traction, and I honestly think LinkedIn, XING and other comparable professionally-oriented social networks do a fine job with the recruitment part of the equation, even within the target group KODA is eying (GenY&#8217;ers).</p>
<p>That said, KODA says it&#8217;s seeing increasing traction even while it&#8217;s only been in beta for a short while, claiming it has established relationships with over 350 corporations, non-profit organizations and private businesses and already featuring thousands of job opportunities in various U.S. cities and regions. The main reason it has achieved the latter is that its crawler can pull up-to-date job listings directly from employers’ websites and put them on display on KODA.us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m skeptical about KODA&#8217;s ability to make waves in this space. Your take?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/bixlogo.jpg" width="210" height="121" />It must be disconcerting to a big Internet company to shut down a whole website and nobody even notices. Not even a short note on Twitter from a concerned user until now. But that's what apparently happened.

At some point Yahoo shut down <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bix">Bix</a>, a karaoke and contest website that they <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/16/yahoo-acquires-contest-site-bix/">acquired in late 2006</a>. Yes, at some point in 2006 someone at Yahoo said "Karaoke? Contests? We gotta own that!"

We first wrote about Bix in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/17/bix-sees-green-in-online-contests/">July 2006</a> and then again in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/09/bix-launches-50000-contest/">August 2006</a>. The company had raised $6.77 million from Sutter Hill Ventures, Trinity, and others prior to the acquisition.

If anyone knows when exactly this shut down, we want to know. It at least needs a proper burial before dropping into the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool">deadpool</a>. We've also got an email in to Yahoo PR.]]></description>

Bill.com looks to help businesses streamline the convoluted processes that are often involved in paying bills at large companies. Unlike your typical personal bill payments, which simply require hopping onto your bank's website and transferring funds, large busineses typically have fairly complex approval processes in place before a bill gets paid: various managers have to sign off on the bills, and then they have to get sent to the finance department that handles the actual payments.

As part of the deal, August Capital&#8217;s David Hornik will be joining Bill.com&#8217;s board.  Bill.com has now raised a total of $17 million.</p>
<p>Bill.com looks to help businesses streamline the convoluted processes that are often involved in paying bills at large companies. Unlike your typical personal bill payments, which simply require hopping onto your bank&#8217;s website and transferring funds, large busineses typically have fairly complex approval processes in place before a bill gets paid: various managers have to sign off on the bills, and then they have to get sent to the finance department that handles the actual payments.  Even worse, most businesses still use inefficient paper documents throughout the process.</p>
<p>Bill.com takes the process digital.  To use it, you fax your bills to a specified phone number (any bills that come in digitally can simply be Emailed into the service).  Bill.com automatically scans the document, and lets you Email it to anyone who needs to sign off on the bill before it is paid (mangers click a special link to indicate they approve).  Once everyone has signed off, the finance department can use Bill.com&#8217;s payment system to make the actual transactions.  The service uses OCR to archive all documents for later searching.  And while the service caters in part directly to businesses, Bill.com also appeals to accounting firms, as it can streamline the way they process their clients&#8217; bills.</p>
<p>Bill.com charges a base fee of $24.99 a month for one user, with each additional user running $9.99 (there&#8217;s also a small fee associated with each check payment).  It&#8217;s hard to gauge just how much money companies are saving in terms of time saved using the system, but VP Marketing Jeff Schultz says that companies are reporting upwards of 50% deductions in the amount of time taken to pay bills.</p>
<p>Bill.com was founded by René Lacerte, an entrepreneur who has proven he knows what he&#8217;s doing in this space — he previously founded online payroll service <a href="http://www.paycycle.com/">PayCycle</a>, which was just <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/smallBusinessNews/idUSTRE5524K620090603">acquired</a> last month by Intuit for $170 million.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vegasbaby-98x200.jpg" width="98" height="200" />Revision3's PR firm is urging me to write about the upcoming <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=208915010250">Diggnation episode</a> being filmed in at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose">Kevin Rose</a> and Ashton Kutcher. And I aim to please. But what I can't figure out is, how do projects with Ashton Kutcher like this and the disastrous <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/20/ashton-kutchers-24hoursatsundance-conflicted-and-dangerous/">24HoursAtSundance</a> earlier this year help Digg find relevance in today's world?

Sure, Kevin gets to hang out with the Hollywood crowd and become BFF with Ashton. And yes, I'm somewhat interested in hearing all about <em>"Ashton Kutcher's Web 2.0 Strategy,"</em> as pitched to me in the email (in the same way that I can't not look at accidents as I drive by). But none of the story ideas pitched to us (Ashton and Kevin: Why Traditional Hollywood cares about Unconventional Silicon Valley, How mainstream consumer products are merging with new media, Why Ashton thought it was important, in fact, critical to reach Diggnation’s audience), along with "exclusive access" to Kevin and Ashton, really interest me. What I really want to know is this:

Why is Kevin Rose screwing around in Las Vegas with a movie star when a fricking URL redirect service is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/bitlys-grand-plans-and-their-inevitable-clash-with-digg-bitly-now/">preparing to eat their lunch</a>?]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vegasbaby.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot" alt="" />Revision3&#8217;s PR firm is urging me to write about the upcoming <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=208915010250">Diggnation episode</a> being filmed in at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose">Kevin Rose</a> and Ashton Kutcher. And I aim to please. But what I can&#8217;t figure out is, how do projects with Ashton Kutcher like this and the disastrous <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/20/ashton-kutchers-24hoursatsundance-conflicted-and-dangerous/">24HoursAtSundance</a> earlier this year help Digg find relevance in today&#8217;s world?</p>
<p>Sure, Kevin gets to hang out with the Hollywood crowd and become BFF with Ashton. And yes, I&#8217;m somewhat interested in hearing all about <em>&#8220;Ashton Kutcher&#8217;s Web 2.0 Strategy,&#8221;</em> as pitched to me in the email (in the same way that I can&#8217;t not look at accidents as I drive by). But none of the story ideas pitched to us (Ashton and Kevin: Why Traditional Hollywood cares about Unconventional Silicon Valley, How mainstream consumer products are merging with new media, Why Ashton thought it was important, in fact, critical to reach Diggnation’s audience), along with &#8220;exclusive access&#8221; to Kevin and Ashton, really interest me. What I really want to know is this:</p>
<p>Why is Kevin Rose screwing around in Las Vegas with a movie star when a fricking URL redirect service is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/bitlys-grand-plans-and-their-inevitable-clash-with-digg-bitly-now/">preparing to eat their lunch</a>?</p>
<p>Digg isn&#8217;t the shiny new startup that it once was. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/twitter-reaches-445-million-people-worldwide-in-june-comscore/">Twitter has almost twice the audience</a> that Digg has (45 million v. 24 million worldwide uniques in June according to Comscore). As recently as March Twitter was still smaller than Digg. Now, it&#8217;s not even close.</p>
<p>Digg&#8217;s product needs serious attention from Kevin. The recent DiggBar changes that enraged users <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/19/diggs-kevin-rose-not-pleased-with-diggbar-change/">caught Kevin off guard</a> because he was on vacation in China and didn&#8217;t know what was happening. He needs to pay attention. Or else relinquish his control of the Digg product to someone else who&#8217;ll pay attention.</p>
<p>The next six months are critical for Digg. They are rolling out a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/17/get-ready-for-real-time-digg-whatever-that-means/">new real time product</a> to try to compete with Bit.ly and Twitter. It seems to me that Digg&#8217;s investors would be happier if he were working on that, instead of partying in Vegas with the guy from Dude, Where&#8217;s My Car?</p>
<p>That being said, I still can&#8217;t wait to hear Kutcher&#8217;s Web 2.0 strategy and his advice on &#8220;merging the worlds of mainstream entertainment and new mediums like Internet Television.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Kevin Rose response in comments below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike, I set aside two days a month to shoot episodes of diggnation (this has been the routine for the last 4yrs), and we shoot several live shows per year. Without a doubt the podcast has proven to be a great tool to spread the word.</p>
<p>Sorry about the strange pitch from the PR agency.</p></blockquote>

You may recall that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/08/google-expands-online-newspaper-archive-search/">at TechCrunch50 last year</a>, Google's <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-mayer">Marissa Mayer</a> demoed this powerful news tool that can search the text of publications far back in time — some over 200 years old.

<p>The recent update saw Google add a bunch of new publications, including some from different parts of the world. And it even has a newspaper in the archives <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jl0XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OCIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2422,359883&amp;dq=">from 1753</a> now. The fact that it&#8217;s searchable is fairly insane.</p>
<p>Google launched with &#8220;millions&#8221; of searchable articles, so now we have to assume it has millions times four (Google didn&#8217;t give an exact number). But this along with its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/07/scan-your-books-and-search-them-on-google/">book scanning efforts</a> are getting impressive in their size and scope (but the book scanning is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-paying-authors-60-per-scanned-book/">not without controversy</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, why Google primarily cares about archiving these old publications is not just for information, but also for the fact that it can sell contextual AdSense ads against them. Look at <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T48VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IgsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5896%2C308034">this article</a> from the Manila Standard about a volcano eruption, it features an ad to get an emergency management degree.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_0126-1-ho.jpg" width="138" height="145" />Last month, we were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/google-loses-engineering-director-who-once-caused-steve-ballmer-to-melt-down/">first to report</a> that Google Engineering Director <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-lucovsky">Mark Lucovsky</a> was leaving the company to join VMware. Lucovsky was with the company for nearly 5 years and was very instrumental in its APIs. And now they're losing another long-time employee who worked in a similar capacity — and yes, he's also going to VMware.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-89221" title="img_0126-1-ho" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_0126-1-ho.jpg" alt="img_0126-1-ho" width="138" height="145" />Last month, we were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/google-loses-engineering-director-who-once-caused-steve-ballmer-to-melt-down/">first to report</a> that Google Engineering Director <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-lucovsky">Mark Lucovsky</a> was leaving the company to join VMware. Lucovsky was with the company for nearly 5 years and was very instrumental in its APIs. And now they&#8217;re losing another long-time employee who worked in a similar capacity — and yes, he&#8217;s also going to VMware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/derek-collison">Derek Collison</a> has been with Google since 2004, most recently serving as a Technical Director working on its search APIs (specifically the AJAX ones) much like Lucovsky. Now he&#8217;s joining his once and future colleague at VMware, where he&#8217;ll apparently be working directly with him again.</p>
<p>Collison <a href="http://twitter.com/dlc0421/status/3107638840">tweeted out</a> the news of his departure today, and engaged some of his former co-workers <a href="http://friendfeed.com/derek/317a9f77/enjoying-my-last-free-red-bull-at-googleplex">on FriendFeed</a> as to what his role will be with VMware. &#8220;<em>Joining up with Vadim and Mark Lucovsky for a bit at VMWare to do some cloud computing stuff,</em>&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Vadim&#8221; is Vadim Spivak, who formerly worked at Google as a Gmail engineer before, yes, leaving to go to VMware.</p>
<p>Certainly, three people out of thousands is not a pattern, but it is interesting that all these of these guys left Google, where they had been for a long time, around the same time, to go work together at an already established company. Plenty of Googlers leave to go to startups, places like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/24/googler-defects-to-twitter-tweets-about-it/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/steal-ben-darnell-leaves-google-reader-team-joins-friendfeed/">FriendFeed</a>, no doubt dreaming of riches and more control, but VMware IPOed in 2007.</p>
<p>Well, at least Google got its CEO <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">back full-time again today</a>.</p>

Ancestry.com offers some basic functionality for free, but to tap into the site's vast library of historical records, which includes billions of documents and photographs, users have to sign up for a premium subscription. The company claims nearly 1 million subscribers, with an average revenue of $16.50 per subscriber. With monthly churn of 4.1% and a acquisition cost of $67.30, the company can make its money back in four months for each subscriber.  In the last six months, Ancestry has made $107 million, with profits of $8 million and a run rate of $200 million.

<p>Back in October 2007 Spectrum Equity Investors led a $300 million <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/16/private-buyout-of-ancestrycom-for-300-million/">buyout</a> of Ancestry.com&#8217;s parent company, The Generations Network (which now calls itself Ancestry.com Inc).  But it wasn&#8217;t a complete buyout, with employees and possibly some outside investors retaining equity in the company. </p>
<p>Ancestry has been on the web for over twelve years, but its roots extend back to 1984, when the company published family history books.  The company now employs more than 600 people.</p>

Advertising and branding are very complicated and very unpredictable fields, and success can be measured according to any number of metrics. Modernista, the ad agency behind the soft-talking-lady ads that only occasionally seem to be talking about phones, seems to be measuring success based on attention. Of course, the attention is almost entirely negative, but that doesn't faze them.

<a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=138251">In an article in Ad Age</a>, Executive Creative Director at Modernista, Gary Koepke, discusses the oft-maligned "Ms. Hope" spots.

<blockquote>
The Pre is probably being talked about more than other phones right now because of the marketing and advertising, and that's a good thing. Could the ads work harder to show exactly how the phone works? Yes, but we knew it would be polarizing people to have a woman not shout at them and tell an interesting story.</blockquote>

<p>Mobclix wants to provide one dashboard for app developers to track and monetize their apps.  It also lets advertisers buy across a variety of apps based on demographic, geo-targeting, and behavioral characteristics. The idea is to aggregate both apps and advertising to reach scale.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/exchange-networks.jpg" class="shot2"/></p>
<p>The exchange supports 20 mobile ad networks at launch, including <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/googles-mobile-adsense-for-iphone-and-android-apps-now-in-public-beta/">Google</a>, Yahoo, Jumptap, and <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/18/videoegg-extends-its-ad-network-to-the-iphone/">VideoEgg</a>.  </p>
<p>One ad network that is missing, however, is <a href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a>.  As perhaps the largest mobile ad network, AdMob&#8217;s absence is noticeable.  But AdMob does not support the mediation layers required for Mobclix to talk to its servers.  (If you are the biggest mobile ad network, it is not in your interest to make it easy for developers to switch).  AdMob also offers its own <a href="  http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/16/admob-is-working-on-an-iphone-app-exchange-to-swap-ads-for-traffic/">quasi-exchange </a> where app developers can swap ad inventory for traffic with each other.  </p>
<p>In the end, app developers will go to wherever they can get the highest price for their ads, while advertisers will gravitate to the ad networks or exchanges with the most inventory.  At this point maybe only an exchange that ropes together multiple ad networks can compete with AdMob.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/money1-215x188.jpg" width="215" height="188" />You'd think in the midst of a recession domain name sales would become less common and be negotiated for far less than the high-priced .com acquisitions we remember from the late nineties and during the dotcom boom. 

The reality, however, is that we've been seen a remarkable amount of high-profile, generic domain names go at fairly high prices for the past 8 months or so (e.g. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/27/toysrus-buys-toyscom-at-auction-for-51-million/">Toys.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/05/candycom-sells-for-a-sweet-3-million/">Candy.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/atts-yellowpages-paid-385-million-in-cash-for-ypcom/">YP.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/12/what-recession-priveco-coughs-up-1-million-for-vibratorscom/">Vibrators.com</a>, etc.).

Earlier today, server.com was sold for a healthy $770,000 by domain brokerage house <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sedo">Sedo</a>, reports <a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2009/08/03/server-com-sells-for-770000-jesus-net-for-124000/">DomainNameWire</a>.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/money1.jpg" class="shot2" />You&#8217;d think in the midst of a recession domain name sales would become less common and be negotiated for far less than the high-priced .com acquisitions we remember from the late nineties and during the dotcom boom. </p>
<p>The reality, however, is that we&#8217;ve been seen a remarkable amount of high-profile, generic domain names go at fairly high prices for the past 8 months or so (e.g. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/27/toysrus-buys-toyscom-at-auction-for-51-million/">Toys.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/05/candycom-sells-for-a-sweet-3-million/">Candy.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/atts-yellowpages-paid-385-million-in-cash-for-ypcom/">YP.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/12/what-recession-priveco-coughs-up-1-million-for-vibratorscom/">Vibrators.com</a>, etc.). </p>
<p>Maybe professional domainers and regular companies with an attractive portfolio are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/17/yahoo-is-now-resorting-to-selling-killer-domain-names-on-the-cheap/">more willing to sell now</a> that cash is in shorter supply than it was before the economy collapsed, or maybe these are all calculated bets made by companies that have the capital required to purchase / invest in quality domain names. Most likely, it&#8217;s a combination of both. </p>
<p>Either way, we haven&#8217;t seen the end of it: earlier today, server.com was sold for a healthy $770,000 by domain brokerage house <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sedo">Sedo</a>, reports <a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2009/08/03/server-com-sells-for-770000-jesus-net-for-124000/">DomainNameWire</a>. Currently parked, the domain name averages only about 12K unique visitors per month according to <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/server.com/">Compete</a>. Hence why I think this is a decent deal for the owner - an individual from Boston, MA - although a lot of professionals from the sector will argue that he could have fetched a lot more for this one.</p>
<p>No word on who actually bought it, but that information will likely surface sooner or later.</p>
<p>More domains were auctioned off today by Sedo (<a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2009/08/03/server-com-sells-for-770000-jesus-net-for-124000/">listed here</a>) but the most apparent ones were definitely server.com, jesus.net ($124,337), omg.com ($80,000) and enlargement.com ($56,000).</p>

Twitter&#8217;s website attracted a total of 44.5 million unique visitors worldwide in June, 2009, according to comScore.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s worldwide audience grew a healthy 19 percent from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/the-twitter-cycle-curiosity-abandonment-addiction-global-visitors-hit-37-million/">May, 2009</a> (and an even healthier 1,460 percent from June, 2008, when its worldwide audience was just 2.9 million).  </p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/twitter-back-on-track-in-june-with-20-million-us-visitors/">20 million</a> of its visitors coming from the U.S., Twitter&#8217;s audience is now 55 percent international.  ComScore now counts it as the No. 52 largest site in the world (bigger than ESPN, just shy of the BBC and Craigslist).</p>
<p>These estimates only count traffic to Twitter.com.  Since more than <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/the-more-followers-you-have-the-more-you-tweet-or-is-it-the-other-way-around/">half of Twitter users</a> don&#8217;t even go to the Website, and instead use Twitter apps to consume and publish Tweets, Twitter&#8217;s total audience is even larger.  But comScore provides a consistent measure of its growth.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bystander.png" class="shot2"/>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention to the tech news at all over the last week, you&#8217;re already very familiar with the outrage that Apple has sparked over its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of Google Voice for the App Store, and its ban of all third-party applications that tap into the service.  But now the fallout of the Google Voice debacle is having an impact on even more independent developers — Apple is apparently holding off on approving applications that could even be tangentially related to Google Voice.</p>
<p>The application is question is <a href="http://www.line2.com/">Line2</a>, which was built by <a href="http://www.toktumi.com">Toktumi</a>, a startup that specializes in helping small businesses use their mobile phones and computers to create office-grade phone systems, even when their employees are scattered across the country. Line2 would allow users to use two different numbers with their iPhones — one which they could hand out for business calls, and the other for personal.  This setup would allow employees to keep their personal numbers private, and also allows businesses to set up professional features on the business line, with features like an phone directory (&#8221;Press 1 for sales&#8230;&#8221;) and a single support number that calls the mobile phones of multiple employees.  Given how many businesses are adopting the virtual office approach, there&#8217;s little doubt that this technology could prove very popular (the recently-released BlackBerry <a href="http://www.line2.com/">version</a> is already starting to gain traction).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Line2 is currently sitting in App Store limbo.  The app&#8217;s developers intitally submitted it on June 5th, and it sat for weeks waiting for approval with no information other than Apple&#8217;s automated &#8220;this app is requiring unexpected additional time for review&#8221; messages.  Finally, on June 23, Toktumi learned that the application had been rejected because it required people to pay through its website rather than Apple&#8217;s subscription services that are integrated with the iPhone 3.0 update.  Toktumi attempted to point out that Salesforce was allowed to offer an application that conducted transactions through the web, but in the end it decided to simply modify the app to comply with Apple&#8217;s requests.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-113.png" class="shot2"/></p>
<p>The company submitted a new version of the Line2 app on July 13, at which point it was asked to submit a demo account for testing (the company had already submitted one).  To no one&#8217;s surprise, they got another Email a few days later stating that the process would require additional time.  And then the Google Voice bomb <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">dropped</a>.  Apple removed every related app on the App Store, citing the rationale that they duplicated existing iPhone functionality and would confuse users.</p>
<p>CEO Peter Sisson was understandably concerned.  Line2 doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with Google Voice, but it does make use of so-called &#8220;virtual numbers&#8221;, which relay calls made to one number (like your business line) back to your iPhone number.  And it also offers other telephony features that &#8216;duplicate&#8217; what&#8217;s offered by the iPhone.  So Sisson reached out to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Philip Schiller</a>, Apple&#8217;s SVP of Worldwide Product Marketing, who has previously dealt with developers on an individual basis when application approvals have taken unusually long.  Sisson sent his Email to Schiller on July 27th — nearly two months since the app was originally submitted.</p>
<p>Schiller responded, stating that he would get back to Sisson by July 29th.  That didn&#8217;t happen.  Sisson sent another message to Schiller with a number of reasons why Line2 was actually <i>good</i> for Apple (it encourages small businesses to use the iPhone) and also pointed out why it wouldn&#8217;t cut into AT&#038;T&#8217;s revenues (the app doesn&#8217;t offer any SMS functionality at all, and all calls are still performed using standard AT&#038;T minutes).  Schiller hasn&#8217;t responded, and Apple has gone almost totally silent on the matter with no other response than that the application is &#8220;still in process&#8221;.</p>
<p>At this point, I doubt Sisson will be getting a response any time soon.  If Apple did grant approval to the app, it would show that duplicating functionality wasn&#8217;t really Apple&#8217;s reason for banning Google Voice (of course, countless other apps mimic portions of the iPhone&#8217;s functionality).  That kind of inconsistency would be nothing new to the App Store, but now that the FCC is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">launching</a> an inquiry into the marketplace&#8217;s approval processes, you can be sure that Apple isn&#8217;t keep on taking any chances.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that Apple has never established consistent guidelines for developers to follow.  That may change soon: the FCC inquiry may force them to change their ways, especially if the process is revealed to be as chaotic as most developers suspect.  Until that happens though, we&#8217;re only going to keep hearing of more casualties of the App Store&#8217;s black box.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-11-166x200.png" width="166" height="200" />So, by now you've probably heard that Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">resigned from Apple's board</a> of directors this morning. You'd think that this would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">the end</a> of the FTC investigation into the close ties between Apple and Google, right? Wrong.

The FTC has released a statement commending Schmidt and Apple's mutual decision for him to step down, but it warns that the investigation is not over yet. Here's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/googlestmt.shtm">their exact wording</a>:
<blockquote>“We have been investigating the Google/Apple interlocking directorates issue for some time and commend them for recognizing that sharing directors raises competitive issues, as Google and Apple increasingly compete with each other,” said Bureau of Competition Director Richard Feinstein. “We will continue to investigate remaining interlocking directorates between the companies.”</blockquote>]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-89147" title="picture-11" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-11.png" alt="picture-11" width="262" height="314" />So, by now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">resigned from Apple&#8217;s board</a> of directors this morning. You&#8217;d think that this would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">the end</a> of the FTC investigation into the close ties between Apple and Google, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>The FTC has released a statement commending Schmidt and Apple&#8217;s mutual decision for him to step down, but it warns that the investigation is not over yet. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/googlestmt.shtm">their exact wording</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have been investigating the Google/Apple interlocking directorates issue for some time and commend them for recognizing that sharing directors raises competitive issues, as Google and Apple increasingly compete with each other,” said Bureau of Competition Director Richard Feinstein. “We will continue to investigate remaining interlocking directorates between the companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So what gives? Well first of all, Schmidt is hardly the only tie between the two companies. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/genentech">Genentech</a> CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/arthur-d-levinson">Arthur Levinson</a> remains on the board for both Apple and Google. While his conflict is obviously not as big as Schmidt&#8217;s was, it wouldn&#8217;t be all that surprising to see Levinson leave one of those board seats now that Google and Apple have businesses that are increasingly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/googles-chrome-os-bomb-has-minimal-fallout-on-apple/">overlapping</a>.</p>
<p>Also interesting is the tie between former Vice President <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/al-gore">Al Gore</a> with Apple and Google. While he resides on Apple&#8217;s board, he also serves as a senior advisor to Google. And he&#8217;s a partner at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers">Kleiner Perkins</a> which has ties to both Apple and Google.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the overlap in people. What this really boils down to is what, if anything, the two companies are doing with regards to their products to be anti-competitive.</p>
<p>There has been no shortage of talk and speculation that Apple and Google have worked together behind the scenes on some key deals. One of those was <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/02/09/apple-asked-google-not-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-and-google-complied/">multi-touch support in the Android</a> operating system. Google has so far not included it in Android, and it was supposedly done because of an agreement with Apple.</p>
<p>Also, Google recently revealed that it had made a Google Latitude app for Apple&#8217;s iPhone, but that it instead turned it into a web app <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/why-is-google-latitude-a-web-app-and-not-a-native-app-because-apple-said-so/">at Apple&#8217;s behest</a>. The reason was that Apple said it too closely resembled its own Maps application — which Google also helped create.</p>
<p>And now we have the whole Google Voice situation. Apple <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected</a> the Google Voice app and removed all the related apps that it had previously accepted. And things get even more complicated when you consider that while AT&amp;T is issuing what appear to be <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/03/paczkowski-att">non-denial denials</a>. A few sites, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">including this one</a>, have heard that AT&amp;T <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-app-store">played a role</a> in that. The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC is looking into the matter</a> separately from the FTC, but obviously, it&#8217;s at least somewhat related.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the fallout from this continued investigation? Probably not too much. As we said, Levinson may have to choose a side and step down from one board. But it seems like if that happens, Gore could be safe, since he&#8217;s not technically a part of the &#8220;interlocking directorates,&#8221; as the FTC puts it.</p>
<p>And as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">we wrote back in May</a> when the FTC first launched this investigation, Schmidt was probably safe at the time, and it was more of a warning shot. And given his statement about having no plans to leave Apple&#8217;s board a few days later, he clearly thought so too. But then <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Chrome OS happened</a>, and that changed everything. Schmidt was already excusing himself from the part of Apple meetings where they discussed the iPhone (because of Google Android), and now he would have likely had to do the same with OS X (because of Chrome OS). That&#8217;s what Apple CEO Steve Jobs more or less said in <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/08/03bod.html">his statement</a> this morning.</p>
<p>But it seems like it&#8217;s this Google Voice business that really pushed the situation over the top. Not only was the FTC looking into the relationship between the companies, but now the FCC is. The fact that the FCC investigation was launched on Friday and this news comes to following Monday, seems to say a lot. Schmidt was always going to have to leave Apple&#8217;s board because of Chrome OS, but that is still months away. The FCC investigation seems to accelerate the departure process.</p>
<p>The main goal of the FTC investigation was obviously Schmidt, which is why it released the statement today. But unless they find evidence of collusion in continuing the investigation, its part of this should conclude. But the FCC investigation will remain <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">a very interesting one to watch</a>.</p>

The two aren't commenting on the timing of their exit or what they plan to do next.

<p>The two aren&#8217;t commenting on the timing of their exit or what they plan to do next. The earnout on the acquisition ended in May 2009, and it isn&#8217;t unusual for founders to leave once the acquisition has been fully paid out. Given their history, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be starting something new shortly.</p>

While the site itself appears to be loading (though very slowly), numerous buyers and venders are reporting that sales are not going through. A <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=paypal">quick scan of Twitter</a> tells the same story. And it looks like it has been down for something like an hour and a half now.

Here's what PayPal is officially saying on its <a href="http://developer.paypal-portal.com/t5/Live-Site-Status/Live-Site-874-2-Update-Website-Payments-and-API-s-are/ba-p/146548">developer site</a>:]]></description>

<p>There&#8217;s a mad rush of tips coming into us right now that PayPal&#8217;s online purchasing service is down for the count. While the site itself appears to be loading (though very slowly), numerous buyers and venders are reporting that sales are not going through. A <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=paypal">quick scan of Twitter</a> tells the same story. And it looks like it has been down for something like an hour and a half now.</p>
<p><em>[Update below, it looks like after something like 2 hours of downtime, the service is starting to come back.]</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what PayPal is officially saying on its <a href="http://developer.paypal-portal.com/t5/Live-Site-Status/Live-Site-874-2-Update-Website-Payments-and-API-s-are/ba-p/146548">developer site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>EVENT DETAILS<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Service: Live Site</p>
<p>During the time listed below you may have or currently are experiencing the following:<br />
Buyers may experience error &#8220;Sorry - your last action could not be completed&#8221; on trying to login to www.paypal.com.<br />
Payments via API are intermittently unavailable.</p>
<p>Affected Product(s):<br />
- Website<br />
- PayPal APIs</p>
<p>Start Time: Aug 03, 10:15 AM PDT (Aug 03, 6:15 PM BST)</p>
<p>End Time: On-Going</p>
<p>Our technical teams are working diligently to resolve the issue. We will provide updates until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>We apologize for any impact caused by this incident.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
PayPal Merchant Technical Services</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you go, both the main site and the all-important PayPal APIs are not working. Not good.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how PayPal follows this up. A lot of merchants undoubtedly lost a lot — and I mean a lot — of money today. When Rackspace had its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/30/what-went-down-at-rackspace-yesterday-a-power-outage-and-some-backup-failures/">recent</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/yes-rackspace-is-down-and-so-are-many-of-your-favorite-sites/">failures</a>, it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/someone-needs-to-stop-tripping-over-the-power-cord-at-rackspace/">noted</a> that it would likely have to reimburse customers to the tune of millions of dollars. eBay, which owns PayPal, could be looking at a similar situation.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As of noon PT, things are starting to come back online. Here&#8217;s the update from PayPal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Update: This notification is to inform you that we have started recovering. Some intermittent issues remain which we are currently addressing.</p></blockquote>

But there's a potentially hotter Netflix streaming rumor floating around out there right now: That it's coming to the iPhone.

Multichannel News <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/blog/BIT_RATE/20671-Netflix_to_Stream_Videos_to_iPhone_Nintendo_Wii_Source.php">wrote a story</a> a few days ago that Netflix's Watch Instantly streaming service would soon have an app in Apple's App Store as well be available on the Nintendo Wii, citing an industry executive familiar with Netflix's plans. Both of these devices would seem to play well into Netflix's strategy of getting its service on as many consumer devices as possible (already it's on the Xbox 360, Blu-ray players, the Roku box and built into a few TVs). But this rumor is interesting for a few reasons.

But there&#8217;s a potentially hotter Netflix streaming rumor floating around out there right now: That it&#8217;s coming to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Multichannel News <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/blog/BIT_RATE/20671-Netflix_to_Stream_Videos_to_iPhone_Nintendo_Wii_Source.php">wrote a story</a> a few days ago that Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly streaming service would soon have an app in Apple&#8217;s App Store as well be available on the Nintendo Wii, citing an industry executive familiar with Netflix&#8217;s plans. Both of these devices would seem to play well into Netflix&#8217;s strategy of getting its service on as many consumer devices as possible (already it&#8217;s on the Xbox 360, Blu-ray players, the Roku box and built into a few TVs). But this rumor is interesting for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, Netflix on the iPhone would be awesome, but you have to wonder if Apple wouldn&#8217;t worry about it cutting into services it already provides. That has been the basis for a few app rejections, and it would seem that with on-demand movie streaming, it would remove at least some of the need to buy movies for your device through iTunes.</p>
<p>Second, talk of the service coming to both the iPhone and the Wii is interesting because of Netflix CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reed-hastings">Reed Hastings</a>&#8216; position on Microsoft&#8217;s board of directors. While I&#8217;m sure Netflix&#8217;s overall agenda is outside the influence of Microsoft, remember that Netflix streaming is currently only available on Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360, and none of the other gaming consoles. This is a big advantage for it in terms of being a living room entertainment hub (which all of the consoles aspire to be).</p>
<p>And one would have to imagine that Microsoft would love to see a Netflix streaming app on its Windows Phones (the artists formerly known as Windows Mobile phones) before it sees it on iPhones. I&#8217;m not saying that will happen, but that it may come up between Hastings and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, if such an app were to exist, it would undoubtedly bring up the AT&amp;T bandwidth restriction debate again. While AT&amp;T and Apple allow apps like MLB At Bat to stream video over the network, other apps, like SlingPlayer, are restricted to stream video over WiFi only. AT&amp;T has stated that it doesn&#8217;t want all this video streaming to further clog its pipes, which is also why it would likely restrict <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">a Hulu app</a> that was rumored a few months ago.</p>
<p>But streaming over WiFi is significantly less interesting than being able to do so over 3G. If a Netflix streaming app were to be released and limited to WiFi, you can be sure it wouldn&#8217;t dampen the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">booing of AT&amp;T</a> that has been going on recently. The fact of the matter is that eventually apps such as this are going to need to work over cellular networks and not just WiFi.</p>
<p>Again, the existence of a Netflix streaming app on the iPhone is very much a rumor based on one source, but it is interesting for the potential can of worms it opens.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tommyspace-215x171.jpg" width="215" height="171" />Anyone see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_People">Funny People</a> this weekend? One of the best movies I've seen this year, despite the 10 minute MySpace commercial in the middle of it. 

The two main characters, Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen, visit MySpace for a $300,000 paid comedy gig. Among a variety of <em>"f**ck Facebook, In the Face"</em> jokes (said two or three times. really) was some really good material, including Rogen asking <em>"I wonder if <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson">Tom</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/craig-newmark">Craig</a> from Craigslist would ever get in a fight....Who's tougher? Tom has more friends...Craig has weirder friends though. Craig has friends that are willing to do a lot more for cash, I'll say that."</em>

Sandler also <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#038;videoid=60651520">says</a> <em>"They say the more friends you have on MySpace the less friends you have in real life."</em> 

MySpace cofounder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson">Tom Anderson</a> was also <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#038;videoid=60855846">on set</a> and part of the movie, and has now officially been <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027526/">mixed up</a> with another Tom Anderson on IMDB. Overall it was an amazing commercial for MySpace. The company says they did not pay for the placement.

<p>It really was an excellent movie, and it was no. 1 in the U.S. over the weekend with $23.4 million gross. At 140 minutes long, though, you need to be prepared for a long one.</p>

Over the past few years we've seen 3-D panoramic photographs become popular on the Web.  These are photos taken with special 360-degree cameras and stitched together to mimic the experience of moving through space.  If you've ever used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View</a> feature in Google Maps, you know what a 3-D still photo looks like.  But what if Google Street View used video instead of still photos?  You'd end up with <a href="http://www.yellowbirdsdonthavewingsbuttheyflytomakeyouexperiencea3dreality.com/">YellowBird</a>.

YellowBird is a startup in the Netherlands which has developed its own interactive 3-D video technology, including a 360-degree video camera, software to take the data captured by the camera and stitch it together, and a video player that allows anyone to navigate the video by dragging their mouse around.

<p>Over the past few years we&#8217;ve seen 3-D panoramic photographs become popular on the Web.  These are photos taken with special 360-degree cameras and stitched together to mimic the experience of moving through space.  If you&#8217;ve ever used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View</a> feature in Google Maps, you know what a 3-D still photo looks like.  But what if Google Street View used video instead of still photos?  You&#8217;d end up with <a href="http://www.yellowbirdsdonthavewingsbuttheyflytomakeyouexperiencea3dreality.com/">YellowBird</a>.</p>
<p>YellowBird is a startup in the Netherlands which has developed its own interactive 3-D video technology, including a 360-degree video camera, software to take the data captured by the camera and stitch it together, and a video player that allows anyone to navigate the video by dragging their mouse around.  I&#8217;ve embedded an example video below.  The controls can sometimes be a little overly sensitive, but you&#8217;ll get the idea.  It is a much better experience than navigating through still photos.  It really gives you a sense of walking through a crowd and swiveling your head around.</p>
<p>The startup wants to custom develop 3-D immersive videos for marketing campaigns, and that is probably a good way to make money right now.  But eventually it might be better off creating a platform so that anyone can make similar videos with standard off-the shelf cameras and software. </p>

What happens when the enemy of your enemy is no longer your friend?

<p>What happens when the enemy of your enemy is no longer your friend?  You cast him out, as Steve Jobs seems to have done to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">today resigned his seat from Apple&#8217;s board</a>.  An alliance which began with a mutual distrust of Microsoft is now under strain because of a mutual distrust of each other.  Google is not so much the enemy of Microsoft as it is the enemy of the old model of device-centric computing which <em>both</em> Microsoft and Apple represent.</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the heels of an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">FCC investigation</a> into Apple&#8217;s iPhone App Store that was announced on Friday evening. The subject of that investigation is nominally the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection of a Google app</a>, Google Voice, from the App Store, but it is really an investigation into the closed and arbitrary nature of how apps get approved for the iPhone.</p>
<p>In other words, Google brought down the disapproving scrutiny of the FCC onto Apple on Friday night, and on Monday morning Schmidt resigned.  It is difficult not to make a connection between these two events.  The FCC investigation, of course, is never mentioned in the press release (that would only invite more pesky questions from the FCC).  Instead, what Steve Jobs does say in the press release is that Google&#8217;s entry into mobile operating systems with Android and desktop operating systems with Chrome OS is increasingly becoming a &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; for Schmidt.  As a result, Schmidt had to go.  It also says that both executives &#8220;mutually decided&#8221; it was time for Schmidt to resign.  (I can only imagine how that conversation went. Jobs: &#8220;You are going to have to resign.&#8221;  Schmidt: &#8220;Okay, but can I say it was my idea?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Regardless of how the resignation came about (maybe it was the other way around with Schmidt telling Jobs that the two companies were increasingly coming at odds with each other), what made the two men come to grips with reality all of a sudden?  If nothing else, last Friday&#8217;s letters from the FCC was a wake-up call to Apple that Google stands on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to the evolution of the mobile Web.  Google wants the mobile Web to be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">as open as the Internet</a>.  It&#8217;s entire mobile strategy is predicated on open access for all apps, devices, and services because that creates a larger, more vibrant, and more <em>searchable</em> mobile Web.  </p>
<p>Apple is not about being open.  It never has been. Every app on the iPhone (all 50,000 of them) must be approved individually, for instance.  This difference in approach wasn&#8217;t a problem until Google started to have mobile aspirations of its own.  Asked to choose between furthering Apple&#8217;s mobile agenda or Google&#8217;s, Schmidt must choose Google&#8217;s. It is his fiduciary duty.  That conflict is only going to grow. And that is perhaps why Jobs says his &#8220;effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished.&#8221;  Also, the more they compete, the more they expose themselves to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">antitrust questions from the FTC</a> as long as Schmidt remains on the board.  </p>
<p>Schmidt had to go.  Not just because of the dust-up with the FCC and the Google Voice app.  But because Google has a different set of agendas which already are putting strains on the relationship. Google wants to diminish the importance of any single computing device in favor of Web apps which sit in the cloud and are accessible from <em>all</em> devices—mobile phones, Macbooks, Dell laptops, or whatever.  As much as is physically possible, it wants to replace the operating system with the Web.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is a bigger threat to Apple than Microsoft ever was.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/goog-appe.png" class="shot2" />Lots of people will be arguing today that this was inevitable, but the news comes faster than expected. Google CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> is no longer going to sit on Apple&#8217;s Board of Directors, nearly 3 years after accepting a seat.</p>
<p>The resignation comes a few days after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">the FCC sent letters</a> to Google, Apple and AT&#038;T <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">inquiring</a> why <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">Apple denied the Google Voice application</a> from its iPhone App Store.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/08/03bod.html">statement</a> on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple today announced that Dr. Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Google, is resigning from Apple’s Board of Directors, a position he has held since August 2006.</p>
<p>“Eric has been an excellent Board member for Apple, investing his valuable time, talent, passion and wisdom to help make Apple successful,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “Unfortunately, as Google enters more of Apple’s core businesses, with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/android">Android</a> and now <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Chrome OS</a>, Eric’s effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished, since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, we have mutually decided that now is the right time for Eric to resign his position on Apple’s Board.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Google has provided us with the following statement from Schmidt:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have very much enjoyed my time on the Apple Board.  It&#8217;s a fantastic company.  But as Apple explained today we&#8217;ve agreed it makes sense for me to step down now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hardly surprising, and it&#8217;s good to see both come clean on the situation: you can <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/googles-chrome-os-bomb-has-minimal-fallout-on-apple/">argue</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/11/google-stealing-apples-ideas-and-other-tales-of-accidental-corporate-espionage/">all</a> you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">like</a>, but Google&#8217;s foray into the mobile and computer operating systems, the two products mentioned in the statement (not to mention Chrome in the browser space), must have been quite the thorn in Apple&#8217;s and Jobs&#8217; side. And I&#8217;m quite certain that the whole Google Voice App / FCC debacle only made the process a bit speedier.</p>
<p>Many people have always found it strange that Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board, but back in August 2006 when he took the seat Google had virtually nothing even remotely competing with Apple&#8217;s core products and services. It&#8217;s only in the last 20 months or so that possible conflicts of interests really became an issue, and we can&#8217;t forget that Schmidt was consequently asked to leave board meetings when critical things were shared about Cupertino&#8217;s plans for the iPhone and the App Store.</p>

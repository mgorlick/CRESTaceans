				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bongobing-215x79.png" width="215" height="79" />The Laptop Company, operator of a web-based shopping platform through its <a href="http://www.BongoBing.com">BongoBing</a> website, has filed a request for an extension of time to oppose Microsoft in its efforts to register a trademark for the name <a href="http://bing.com">“Bing”</a> with the USPTO. Furthermore, The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has effectively granted the extension request until October 28, 2009.

Here's what BongoBing CEO and co-founder Raul Pellerano had to say about it: 



<blockquote>“We have worked hard and invested significant resources in building our BongoBingTM brand and identity, our website and services, and our corporate identity. We believe it is important for a small company like The Laptop Company to continue to use its trademarks and conduct business without confusion in the marketplace.”</blockquote>]]></description>

<p>I have a <a href="http://twitter.com/BongoBing/status/2944855183">sneaking suspicion</a> that The Laptop Company is doing this because of the almost guaranteed press attention this will be getting, in which case its strategy has already paid off. </p>
<p>Hands up if you think they actually have a case.</p>

			<title>Am I Last To Find Out You Can Circumvent PDF Usage Restrictions With Gmail?</title>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/unlock.gif" class="shot2" />I expect many of you already were aware of this, but I can imagine at least some of you aren&#8217;t yet, so here goes: apparently you can lift the usage restrictions from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">Adobe PDF</a> files by simply forwarding them as attachments to your <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> account and <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=30719&#038;hl=en">opening them in HTML mode</a> right from your inbox. That way, you can copy whatever the &#8217;secured&#8217; PDF contains to a text editing program and do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>For your reference: PDFs (Portable Document Format) can be encrypted so that a password is needed to view or edit its content, and they can also contain embedded DRM restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing.</p>
<p>Turns out the &#8220;View in HTML&#8221; feature in Gmail can display an HTML version of the encrypted file, stripping out the restrictions. Part of the layout might be lost in the process, but the text can easily be extracted with a simple copy/paste command. In case the original PDF file had printing restrictions, those are stripped as well.</p>
<p>I searched a bit for similar reports and found <a href="http://chosaq.net/archives/2006/04/circumvent-pdf-drm-with-gmail.html">this article</a>, dated April 2006, which was one of the first to discover the trick. The same blog later <a href="http://chosaq.net/archives/2006/05/gmail-cripples-drmed-pdf-files-view-as-html-functionality.html">updated readers</a> on the situation, stating Google crippled the security circumvention so that DRMed PDF files could no longer be opened in HTML mode, but a quick test with a secured file just worked fine right here and now. (<strong>Update:</strong> apparently, it doesn&#8217;t <em>always</em> work)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but this&#8217;ll save me some trouble next time someone sends me an encrypted Adobe PDF file that I&#8217;d like to copy or edit. Unless it&#8217;s illegal, in which case this post doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>

After his arrest, and without a lawyer present, McKinnon admitted to hacking, but denies it was malicious or that he caused damage costing $800,000 (£487,000). The argument of his lawyers was not that he shouldn't be tried, but that he should be tried in the UK and that his extreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>, an autism spectrum disorder, should be taken into account, especially since it could lead to suicide, if he was to be extradited.

He faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted in the U.S. of what prosecutors have called "the biggest military computer hack of all time". He accessed 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa.

Now, exactly what was this hack? McKinnon has always insisted he was looking for classified documents on UFOs which he believed the US authorities had suppressed. This is not a normal guy here. This is a mega geek who believed in UFOs. We're not talking terrorist material. He's been described as a 43-year-old "UFO eccentric". 

In fact McKinnon's case reminds me very much of the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Forbes Nash, Jr.</a>, the subject of the 2001 movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/">A Beautiful Mind</a>. Nash was a mathematical genius who suffered from extreme paranoia - but his work on game theory ended up contributing to U.S. strategy during the Cold War.

Should Gary McKinnon therefore be left to rot in a U.S. jail for the rest of his life? Or should his skills be put to better use?]]></description>

This is not an easy decision.

I was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/">there</a> in January 2007 when it was announced and I bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone">first iPhone</a> as soon as it was available. I happily bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3g">iPhone 3G</a> a year later. I've proudly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">yelled</a> <em>"I Am A Member Of The Cult Of iPhone."</em> I've been an unabashed cheerleader for the device <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/mossberg-levy-and-arrington-talk-iphone-yahoo-on-charlie-rose/">to all who'll listen</a>. And I've <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/14/of-course-youll-keep-developing-for-the-iphone/">scoffed</a> at developers who said they'd abandon the platform.

But I'm not going to upgrade to the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3gs">iPhone 3GS</a>. Instead, I'm abandoning the iPhone and AT&#038;T. I will grudgingly pay the $175 AT&#038;T termination fee and then I will move on to another device.

What finally put me over the edge? ]]></description>

<p>This is not an easy decision.</p>
<p>I was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/">there</a> in January 2007 when it was announced and I bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone">first iPhone</a> as soon as it was available. I happily bought the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3g">iPhone 3G</a> a year later. I&#8217;ve proudly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">yelled</a> <em>&#8220;I Am A Member Of The Cult Of iPhone.&#8221;</em> I&#8217;ve been an unabashed cheerleader for the device <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/mossberg-levy-and-arrington-talk-iphone-yahoo-on-charlie-rose/">to all who&#8217;ll listen</a>. And I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/14/of-course-youll-keep-developing-for-the-iphone/">scoffed</a> at developers who said they&#8217;d abandon the platform.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not going to upgrade to the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/iphone-3gs">iPhone 3GS</a>. Instead, I&#8217;m abandoning the iPhone and AT&#038;T. I will grudgingly pay the $175 AT&#038;T termination fee and then I will move on to another device.</p>
<p>What finally put me over the edge? It wasn&#8217;t the routinely dropped calls, something you can only truly understand once you have owned an iPhone (and which <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/02/11/my-big-iphone-break-up/">drove</a> my friend Om Malik to bail). I&#8217;ve lived with that for two years. It&#8217;s not the lack of AT&#038;T coverage at home. I&#8217;ve lived with that for two years, too. It certainly isn&#8217;t the lack of a physical keyboard, that has never bothered me. No, what finally put me over the edge is the Google Voice debacle. </p>
<p>Most of you won&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, so I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>Google Voice is a call management service that lets you determine what calls get through to you based on who&#8217;s calling and what time of day it is, among other factors. It has amazing features, like automatically transcribing all your voicemails. And you can forward calls to any other phone easily and automatically. Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/11/grand-central-to-finally-launch-as-google-voice-its-very-very-good/">overview of the service</a> if you aren&#8217;t familiar with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to use Google Voice but there&#8217;s a big switching cost - changing your phone number. Too many people have that phone number and use it to call in great stories. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m giving that up. And there&#8217;s another problem with Google Voice. When you make outbound calls from a phone, it (obviously) doesn&#8217;t use your Google Voice phone number, so recipients don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s you calling. Those were two hurdles I wasn&#8217;t willing to jump over.</p>
<p>But now Google is planning on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/google-voices-secret-weapon-number-portability/">rolling out number portability</a>, so I can move my mobile phone number to Google. None of my friends, family or contacts have to store a new number.</p>
<p>That still leaves the problem of outbound calls, though. I can move my mobile number to Google and then get a new iPhone account, but outbound calls won&#8217;t be identified because they are on the new number. Google has a solution for that too, though. They are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">releasing apps for a variety of handsets</a> that effectively take over the native dialer, address book and call log. Problem solved. I can use any phone I like, or a bunch of phones, and just choose the one that makes sense at any time. I never have to be tied to a carrier and their restrictive contracts again.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. Apple and AT&#038;T are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">now blocking</a> the iPhone version of the Google Voice app. Why? Because they absolutely don&#8217;t want people doing exactly what I&#8217;m doing - moving their phone number to Google and using the carrier as a dumb pipe.</p>
<p>So I have to choose between the iPhone and Google Voice. It&#8217;s not an easy decision. Except, it sort of is. Google isn&#8217;t forcing the decision on me, Apple and AT&#038;T are. So I choose to work with the company that isn&#8217;t forcing me to do things their way. And in this case, that&#8217;s Google.</p>
<p>So what phone will I use next? Well, that decision is easy, too. I&#8217;d move to the <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/06/22/review-palm-pre/">Palm Pre</a> because I believe it is the best phone out there other than the iPhone 3GS. But Google hasn&#8217;t created an app for the Palm Pre yet, just Android and Blackberry phones. So for now I&#8217;m going to use the new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/21/t-mobile-will-drop-its-second-android-phone-the-mytouch-3g-this-august-for-199/">Android myTouch 3G</a> along with the Google Voice App. As soon as something better comes out, or Google makes an app for the Pre, I&#8217;ll switch. And keep the same phone number. No long term contracts for me.</p>
<p>And Apple, if you ever decide to put the hammer down on AT&#038;T and do the right thing for your loyal users, I&#8217;ll consider switching back. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll just use one of many iPod Touches laying around our office to test out new apps.</p>

<p>eBay is developing new peer-to-peer software to run the <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/skype">Skype service</a>, they revealed in a quarterly SEC statement. </p>
<p>The existing peer-to-peer software is controlled by <a href="http://www.joltid.com/">Joltid</a>, a company controlled by Skype&#8217;s founders Zennstrom and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/janus-friis">Janus Friis</a>.

<p>eBay is developing the new software in the event they lose the right to continue to license that technology, but warns that <em>&#8220;such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>This comes as eBay prepares to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/breaking-ebay-announces-plans-to-sell-skype/">spin off Skype</a> as in independent public company. And the service is surging in popularity, with 480 million registered users and $170 million in quarterly revenue.</p>
<p>The case isn&#8217;t scheduled for trial until June 2010. Don&#8217;t expect an IPO before that, unless a settlement is reached quickly.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000119312509157212/d10q.htm">10Q</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Skype licenses peer-to-peer communication technology from Joltid Limited pursuant to a license agreement between the parties. The parties had been discussing a dispute over the license. In March 2009, Skype Technologies S.A. filed a claim in the English High Court of Justice (No. HC09C00756) against Joltid Limited. Following the filing of the claim, Joltid purported to terminate the license agreement between the parties. In particular, Joltid has alleged that Skype should not possess, use or modify certain software source code and that, by doing so, and by disclosing such code in certain U.S. patent cases pursuant to orders from U.S. courts, Skype has breached the license agreement. Joltid has brought a counterclaim alleging that Skype has repudiated the license agreement, infringed Joltid’s copyright and misused confidential information. On the basis of, among other things, the parties’ mutual dealings since the execution of the license agreement, Skype asked the English High Court for declaratory relief, including findings that Skype is not in breach of the license agreement, that Joltid’s notice of breach and subsequent notice of termination are invalid, and that Joltid has certain indemnity obligations in relation to the U.S. patent proceedings. Trial is currently scheduled for June 2010. Although Skype is confident of its legal position, as with any litigation, there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation. Skype has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through Joltid. However, such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive. If Skype was to lose the right to use the Joltid software as the result of the litigation, and if alternative software was not available, Skype would be severely and adversely affected and the continued operation of Skype’s business as currently conducted would likely not be possible. </p></blockquote>

Developers put their heart and soul into building an application for the iPhone App Store only to have it rejected by Apple. And sometimes apps are at first accepted and then later pulled for odd reasons. And sometimes app updates are rejected, even though there isn&#8217;t much difference with the version accepted. We get a half dozen or so stories sent to us now <em>every single day</em>. It&#8217;s no wonder that a lot of mobile developers are growing wary of the App Store. But Steven Frank is not one of those developers.</p>
<p>Steven Frank doesn&#8217;t make iPhone apps, specifically for the reasons stated above. But he is a very popular Mac developer, that co-founded the OS X development house <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>, makers of the popular coding application <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, among other apps. Frank is well-known in some circles as a Mac enthusiast. You know, the kind of person that is often derided as a &#8220;fanboy.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why what I&#8217;m about to tell you is surprising: He&#8217;s ditching his iPhone.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/152606616/im-furious-with-apple-and-at-t-right-now-with">a candid post</a> today, Frank explains his utter frustration with both Apple and AT&amp;T over the way they&#8217;ve handled the device and its developers. The whole Google Voice <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">fiasco</a> was the last straw for him. Again, Frank doesn&#8217;t make iPhone apps, but he&#8217;s simply disgusted as an end-user — someone who pays close to or over $100 a month, and can&#8217;t use a range of apps that are available on other phones, including some also on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>And so he&#8217;s now ditching his iPhone and boycotting any device that runs the iPhone OS (including, if applicable, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/report-the-large-form-ipod-touch-apples-tablet-on-track-for-early-2010/">rumored Mac tablet</a>). He says he&#8217;s going to get a Palm Pre, a device he considers inferior to the iPhone, but one that doesn&#8217;t (at least so far) have the app issues the iPhone does. (Nor does it have the AT&amp;T issues.)</p>
<p>Is Frank crazy? If he is, he&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Perhaps you heard about Om Malik of GigaOM <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/02/11/my-big-iphone-break-up/">doing the same thing</a> over frustrations with AT&amp;T several months ago. And as someone who covers the iPhone ecosystem quite a bit, I&#8217;ve had a number of discussions with iPhone users who have either ditched their device over similar concerns, or are considering it.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not there yet. I still consider the iPhone to be too far ahead of the other smartphones even with its (sometimes major) flaws in the App Store. But I&#8217;m getting much closer than I ever imagined to looking at other phones simply because of my <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">complete and utter disliking of AT&amp;T</a> at this point. At the very least, if Apple doesn&#8217;t get rid of the AT&amp;T exclusivity agreement next year (which, for the record, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">I think it will</a>), I&#8217;m going to unlock my iPhone to use it on another network.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a separate issue from Frank&#8217;s. He&#8217;s right about Apple&#8217;s often odd, and sometimes downright hostile actions towards developers in regards to the iPhone. It needs a better set of guidelines for developers to work with, because clearly, the current ones aren&#8217;t cutting it. And it needs to be more consistant with adhering to its guidelines. I&#8217;d also say that some more transparency would be nice, but I know that will fall upon deaf ears. This is Apple, after all.</p>
<p>The iPhone and the App Store remain too far ahead of the competition for one person, no matter how big, or even a group of people leaving, to have much of an impact. But Apple has to be careful that its rivals don&#8217;t mature quicker than anticipated (the Pre finally opened its webOS SDK, for example), or we could see some serious defections. By that I mean at first some developers, fed up with the App Store, may move on to other platforms. And that may lead to more doing then same. Eventually, that will trickle down to the end-users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that will happen, but there is a lot of outcry for changes right now. And it&#8217;s getting louder everyday.</p>

Consumer startups are tough. You have two basic choices: A paid offering or a free offering (or freemium). If you charge people a penny, you’ll turn off the bulk of your visitors. If you offer free services, you might grow to be the next YouTube, Wordpress or Facebook. Most entrepreneurs are not risk-averse and the dream of being big is just too appealing and the majority of us take the “free-route”.

Once you offer something for free, all shades of people will try to benefit from your service. You’d think a service like Sampa with a strong family and baby branding would just repel small business, teenagers, criminals, etc. but that’s not the case at all. And I suspect most blogging services; photo-sharing or web-site building solutions face the exact same issue we did.

<p>Once you offer something for free, all shades of people will try to benefit from your service. You’d think a service like Sampa with a strong family and baby branding would just repel small business, teenagers, criminals, etc. but that’s not the case at all. And I suspect most blogging services; photo-sharing or web-site building solutions face the exact same issue we did.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs and investors will look at data analysis and talk about averages or totals: Averages number of blog posts per user per week, average number of sign-ins per user per month, viral coefficient, total number of active users, etc. Entrepreneurs who are more sophisticated will split their “averages” and “totals” in two or three groups. For example, fixing one of the dimensions into users that sign-in 30 or more times per month (very engaged), between 10 and 29 times per month (engaged), and between 0-9 times per month (on the brink of leaving) and then run the averages and totals for the different groups (e.g. &#8220;very engaged users upload 25 pictures/month, engaged users upload 7 pictures/month, etc.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Very few startups actually look at demographic and psychographic data as a way to group their users. Primarily, because it’s hard to get gender, age, income, interests and intentions without asking the user, and once you ask them you might just scare them way or get the wrong information.</p>
<p>One time we went to pitch Sampa to a VC in Seattle, and out of the blue he mentions this other startup growing amazingly fast – had nothing to do with our business. After the meeting I went to check the startup website. Their Compete and Alexa growth was just amazing. Their website contained profiles of all users since it was a public social network. So I clicked on the profile of the 20 people featured on their homepage (“most recent users to join”). Of those, about 75% were girls between the age of 9 and 13 – likely the worst demographic to make any revenue from.</p>
<p>Did the startup know about this? Oh, yeah. Did that VC that was looking at investing on them? Likely not.</p>
<p>In the middle of 2008 we decide to do a qualitative analysis of our user base. People of all kinds were creating sites on Sampa. There wasn’t an automated way to know if it was a baby site, a family site, a small business, a technology blog, etc. We looked at more than 300 sites, randomly selected and created a spreadsheet with the category, the demographic of the author (if we could figure out) and we plugged that into our own analytic system to split our averages and totals for each site category. The results sucked!</p>
<p>Just 20% of our users were on the target audience. That meant 80% were not building any kind of family or baby site. Ok, maybe we can live with that. But it turned out that more than 25% were by pre-teens. There are two problems with that: First, It’s actually illegal in the US and most countries to allow a younger than 13-year-old to sign up to your service without parental consent. Second, pre-teens are not a great audience to build an advertising-based business model.</p>
<p>However the data showed an even worse picture. Pre-teens were a quick burning flame. They would come, upload lots of pictures, write lots of blog posts, “bling” their site, invite 20+ friends and they would be completely gone in a month. That behavior skewed our data enough that once we looked at our growth, viral rates, and everything else, our business didn’t look so great.</p>
<p>Being Proactive Can Backfire</p>
<p>Can you force users to comply with your Terms-Of-Service and still be successful on a UGC service? Yes, you can. Facebook manage to be very aggressive on the enforcement of their TOS, and so did Flickr. However, if you look at most Web 2.0 startups, they are not doing that at all. The most prominent case is YouTube, which allowed copyright infringement on their website and can plot a $1.6B exit based on their “turn a blind eye” strategy.</p>
<p>We didn’t do that at Sampa, and I’m sure we could have seen 2 or 3 times more growth if we had used the same strategy. We proactively removed pre-teens websites. They weren’t easy to find, but every time we found one, we would remove the website and notify the owner she was 12-years-old. They would be mad at us and tell that “Jamie, Emily and Sally also have a website on Sampa”, and we would say thank you and delete all their friends websites too.</p>
<p>We would also proactively delete porn websites. There is nothing wrong with porn. It’s not illegal or immoral in my view, but it didn’t go well with our family-oriented business proposition. Also, most UGC porn sites are infringing in someone else copyright and we just didn’t want to deal with DMCA or lawyers.</p>
<p>We also found criminal websites, from people trying to steal credit-card and passwords to the ugly side of online pedophilia. We had the FBI come over twice to collect evidence.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget link-farms. Although we had CAPTCHA and email confirmation for new websites, every once in a while someone managed to create dozens of websites in a single day all full of links to some bank, real estate agent, mortgage broker, auto dealer, etc. I’m sure the business that were benefiting from it didn’t know they hired a “black-hat” SEO.</p>
<p>Pretty much every Social Network-builder, website builder or content sharing site deals with the same issues we dealt with. A good number of entrepreneurs (and most investors) will be oblivious to those facts and just think that everything is going great and the growth is sustainable and proof they are creating great value and soon will be able to turn a huge profit or to sell for hundreds of millions of dollars, until someone takes the time to figure out what people are using their service for and finds out it’s really not what they thought it was.</p>

That community is a ghost town - raise your hand if you've even heard of it, let alone visited it. At some point, they'll likely shut it down as quietly as possible.

But they are still serious about gunning for the LinkedIn crowd and all those monetization opportunities (jobs, ads and a heck of a marketing pool for WSJ subscriptions). They've been working on a new social network, to be called WSJ Connect, we've confirmed. And instead of building it internally, like they did with WSJ Community, they've enlisted the help of another arm of parent company News Corp. - <a href="http://slingshotlabs.com">Slingshot Labs</a>.

WSJ Connect is still in the planning/conceptual stages, says one source, but there is "strong interest" to move the project forward. Importantly, it would leverage the WSJ brand but would be a separate property and unencumbered by the need for a paid subscription to the newspaper.]]></description>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-80.png" class="shot2"/>Anyone who has ever tried to use Gmail as a central hub for their Email has likely fallen prey to one of the service&#8217;s annoying flaws: there was no way to use another site&#8217;s outgoing SMTP servers to send Email.  For the vast majority of people this wasn&#8217;t an issue — Gmail was happy to send your Email for you from your Gmail account, along with message indicating that it was being sent &#8220;On Behalf Of&#8221; your other account.  But those three words were still there, serving as a constant thorn in our sides.  And to make matters worse, it could also confuse people: they might start sending messages to your Gmail account rather than your primary Email address.  Today, you can kiss those &#8220;On Behalf Of&#8221;&#8217;s goodbye, as Gmail has just started <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/send-mail-from-another-address-without.html">allowing</a> users to send their messages from third party SMTP servers.</p>
<p>If the previous paragraph confused you, here&#8217;s an explanation: Many people like to use Gmail&#8217;s web interface for their Email but don&#8217;t have the option of using Google Apps on their mail server, especially when it&#8217;s for their work account.  Fortunately there&#8217;s a work around to this: simply have your work Email account auto-forward all incoming messages to your Gmail account.  The option even allows you to send messages and make them look like they&#8217;re coming from your work account, rather than you Gmail account, but with one caveat: rather than actually send these messages from your work address, Google includes a message that says the message was sent &#8220;<i>On Behalf Of</i>&#8221; your address, while still showing the name of the Gmail account it was actually sent from.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that most people never noticed this (in fact many mail clients don&#8217;t show the &#8220;On Behalf Of&#8221; at all under default settings), and even if they did see it they probably didn&#8217;t care in the slightest.  But it&#8217;s still been a source of annoyance for many of us.</p>

Now it's ready to begin a quiet rollout today, in beta, for users around the globe.

Here's why this matters: Right off the bat, MySpace Mail with a sexy new interface is a major player in the e-mail space based on sheer size alone. With nearly 130 million global users, it will enter the field as the 4th largest email provider in the world, and 2nd largest in the U.S. And it's being built on top of the MySpace Messaging service that plenty of people are already using a lot — it accounts for some 20% of MySpace's site traffic, we're told.

Here's what else is nice: Because MySpace has had so-called vanity URLs since its inception (unlike Facebook, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/you-have-three-days-to-pick-your-facebook-vanity-url/">just rolled out the feature</a>), you can use those as your email address with the new MySpace Mail. So for a page that resides at myspace.com/techcrunch, the email would be techcrunch@myspace.com, for example. And, if you don't like the vanity URL you currently have, MySpace is giving you the opportunity to change it to something else (assuming it's available). This would also change your vanity URL for your profile.]]></description>

Now it&#8217;s ready to begin a quiet rollout today, in beta, for users around the globe.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why this matters: Right off the bat, MySpace Mail with a sexy new interface is a major player in the e-mail space based on sheer size alone. With nearly 130 million global users, it will enter the field as the 4th largest email provider in the world, and 2nd largest in the U.S. (see chart). And it&#8217;s being built on top of the MySpace Messaging service that plenty of people are already using a lot — it accounts for some 20% of MySpace&#8217;s site traffic, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88456" title="picture-203" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-203.png" alt="picture-203" width="363" height="282" />Here&#8217;s what else is nice: Because MySpace has had so-called vanity URLs since its inception (unlike Facebook, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/you-have-three-days-to-pick-your-facebook-vanity-url/">just rolled out the feature</a>), you can use those as your email address with the new MySpace Mail. So for a page that resides at myspace.com/techcrunch, the email would be techcrunch@myspace.com, for example. And, if you don&#8217;t like the vanity URL you currently have, MySpace is giving you the opportunity to change it to something else (assuming it&#8217;s available). This would also change your vanity URL for your profile.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s different in this new version? Well, besides the obvious upgrades to the overall look, there&#8217;s a new Mail Activity Stream. This basically gives users a real-time view of what people you are having a conversation with, are doing on the site. The new MySpace Mail also allows you to embed photos in one step, and send music and video as attachments.</p>
<p>And like Yahoo Mail, MySpace Mail comes with an unlimited amount of storage space. Contrast that with Google&#8217;s popular Gmail, which limits to just over 7 GB (though it is consistently growing).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-88438" title="3" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3-630x513.jpg" alt="3" width="630" height="513" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/28/myspace-shows-facebook-how-its-done-google-gears-to-power-messaging/">MySpace using Gears</a> to do cool things with its messaging service in the past, and this new MySpace Mail will also utilize it to allow for power searching of mail.</p>
<p>So the big question is, how does it compare to what Facebook is offering? Well, as we&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/03/urgent-changes-are-needed-to-facebook-messaging/">written before</a>, Facebook mail has a lot of issues. Here&#8217;s how they stack up on some features (along with the other big guys):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88474" title="8" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/8.jpg" alt="8" width="630" height="398" /></p>
<p>As we said, this new MySpace Mail will begin rolling out today in beta, and it will continue to reach users across the globe over the next few weeks. When you first see it on your account, you&#8217;ll be greeting by a walk-through screen (pictured above) to set it up for the first time. This is where you&#8217;ll be able to choose which address you wish to use.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the core functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mail center provides a snapshot of all your mail activities including messages, sent messages, requests, and notifications</li>
<li>Send and receive messages from inside or outside the MySpace network</li>
<li>Unlimited file storage</li>
<li>One click to embed photos directly from your profile or desktop</li>
<li>Send and receive file attachments including music and video</li>
<li>Search within Mail using our Google Gears implementation</li>
<li>Check out friends’ activities in real time via the new Mail Activity Stream module</li>
<li>Address book that automatically saves your contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of privacy, here&#8217;s what MySpace is saying about the product:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MySpace Mail is safe and reliable.</strong> MySpace has always taken a holistic approach to privacy and Mail is no exception.  MySpace Mail empowers users to be as open or as private as they choose.  Just like traditional mail, users can choose to receive messages from anyone whether they are in the MySpace network or not, while enhanced privacy features enable users to receive mail from only their MySpace ‘friends.’  Leading anti-spam technology and virus scanning ensure a safe, spam-free mail experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are a ton of screenshots:</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/frankieval.png" class="shot2"/>Over the last few days we&#8217;ve seen a lot of attention centered on the new iPhone <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/weve-seen-the-spotify-iphone-app-in-detail-and-its-pretty-damn-good/">application</a> from <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, the so-called &#8216;iTunes Killer&#8217; subscription service that lets you plays songs on demand from a library of millions of tracks.   We still <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/spotify-in-the-iphone-app-store-—-but-will-apple-approve-it/">don&#8217;t know</a> if that app is going to make it through Apple&#8217;s nebulous approval process, but it&#8217;s already got some possible competition: <a href="http://www.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>, a streaming music service that lets you stream nearly any song from its web interface, has its own iPhone app ready for release and it&#8217;s just about to submit it to Apple.  Like Spotify, the application lets you search for any song you want and stream it from the cloud almost instantly.</p>
<p>Now Grooveshark just needs to face the daunting Apple approval process.  So will it make it though unscathed?  Almost certainly not.</p>
<p>Grooveshark is a great service — the web interface is slick, and you can usually find whatever song you&#8217;re looking for in a matter of seconds, free of charge.  But it&#8217;s also not exactly on solid legal footing.  The company is holding true to its comparison to a &#8216;YouTube for music&#8217;, allowing users to upload whatever they want and generally only policing when they receive takedown notices, which doesn&#8217;t prevent the bulk of copyrighted songs from making their way onto the site (in its early days YouTube thrived on copyrighted content using a similar strategy) .  CEO Sam Tarantino says that Grooveshark is currently hammering out deals with the major record labels to remedy this issue, but EMI changed tactics midway through negotiations and decided to <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090617/another-music-startup-sued-emi-takes-grooveshark-to-court/">sue</a> the company instead which isn&#8217;t helping their efforts.</p>
<p>Still, Tarantino sounds optimistic about the future of the company, even if he isn&#8217;t counting on the iPhone app getting approved just yet.  The website gets 1.3 million visitors a month, 750,000 of which have registered.  The company is finalizing how it will deploy a subscription model (likely in the $5-$15 a month range), which will give it an added boost of legitimacy, and revenue.  Until then though, I wouldn&#8217;t expect this to pop up in the App Store any time soon.</p>

<p>We on the web are a simple folk — especially us males. We need but two things to keep us happy: Explosions and boobs. And thank God someone has finally cut through all the BS, and given us exactly what we want in one brilliant site called yes, <a href="http://www.explosionsandboobs.com/">Explosions and Boobs</a>.</p>
<p>The site is actually more elaborate than it may seem at first glorious glance. If you click on either the explosion picture or the picture of the boobs, you will get new pictures of explosions and boobs! Brilliant. It&#8217;s hours of endless fun waiting to happen. Who needs to sit through an entire Michael Bay movie when you have this?</p>
<p>Just go to it and be amazed. Obviously, it may not be safe for everyone&#8217;s place of work. But it&#8217;s apparently safe enough for <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-lanzone-2">Jim Lanzone</a>, the former CEO of Ask.com to <a href="http://twitter.com/jlanzone/status/2938499529">tweet</a> about it. Or maybe not. As Michael <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/2938640042">tweets</a> in response, &#8220;<em>see this is why you got fired as CEO of Ask.com.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Alright, alright calm down. Lanzone wasn&#8217;t really fired as Ask.com CEO. But for those who read it on Twitter and assumed that it must be true, consider this the official debunking.</p>

When the browser hits the milestone, more information should also be available <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/news_events">here</a>.</p>
<p>Firefox has made a major dent in Internet Explorer&#8217;s marketshare over the past few years. The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/05/since-march-internet-explorer-lost-114-percent-share-to-firefox-safari-and-chrome/">latest numbers</a> put IE&#8217;s share just over 54%, while Firefox approaches 30%. That&#8217;s pretty incredible when you consider that just a few years ago, IE had over 90% marketshare.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88350" title="picture-156" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-156.png" alt="picture-156" width="327" height="112" />This one billion number is obviously for all the versions of Firefox, since it was launched in 2002 (though the Firefox name officially took hold in 2004). The most recent version, 3.5, launched exactly a month ago. It <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/30/firefox-35-soars-past-a-million-downloads-approaching-100-downloads-a-second/">zoomed past</a> a million downloads very quickly, and had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/firefox-35-hits-five-million-downloads-in-24-hours-respectable-but-not-a-record/">5 million downloads</a> after day one — a huge number, though not quite as huge as the Firefox 3.0 launch.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mozilla has just sent a note confirming that it will hit the milestone tomorrow:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s looking like Firefox will reach 1 billion downloads tomorrow (around 3:45 a.m. PT)! You can find out more here: <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/fxbillion">http://www.spreadfirefox.com/fxbillion</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Users of the online feed reader are <a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/daily/2009/07/newsgator-consumer-rss-reader-product-changes-google-sync.html">kindly requested</a> to migrate their subscriptions over to Google Reader before August 31, and NewsGator will provide <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/productinfo/producttransition.aspx">step-by-step instructions</a> and in-product reminders to make sure all goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Speaking of NewsGator&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/default.aspx">desktop RSS readers</a>, which include FeedDemon for Windows and NetNewsWire for Macs, they have both been updated to a new version. Users of the software programs are asked to download the updated versions in the next 30 days, and in another testament to the company&#8217;s friendly relationship with Mountain View it is mostly touting the new synchronization feature with Google Reader as a selling point. The programs are offered free of charge, but that hasn&#8217;t always been the case; in fact they announced they would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/09/newsgator-upgrades-rss-readers-provides-them-for-free/">waiving the cost of the products</a> in January 2008.</p>
<p>NewsGator&#8217;s focus on its paying, enterprise-grade products <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/12/newsgators-focus-on-business-customers-is-paying-off/">makes a lot of sense</a>. just yesterday, the company released an announcement about the momentum for its enterprise social networking product <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/business/socialsites/default.aspx">Social Sites</a>, which recently hit the milestone of 1 million paying users. Earlier this year, we published an <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/01/15/is-enterprise-rss-dead-newsgator-ceo-who-cares/">interesting interview</a> conducted with JB Holston, Newsgator’s CEO, in which he explains their focus on enterprise RSS even if they never call it that themselves.</p>
<p>NewsGator has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newsgator">$39 million</a> to date , mostly from Mobius Venture Capital and Masthead Venture Partners.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-148-185x200.png" width="185" height="200" />You know those idiotic commenters on Digg? Sure you do. You know, "FIRST", "LOLZ", "URGAY", etc. Yeah, those guys. Well Digg took a step today that could possibly make them at least 10,000 times more annoying: <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=921">Email alerts</a>.

Now, let's be clear: This doesn't mean that people who post an item on Digg will get alerts every time someone comments — that would be awful. Instead, this means that if you leave a comment on an item, you will get alerted when someone comments on that. And this will occur only for top-level comments and not nested ones.

And while that may not sound so bad, it's no secret that Digg, like many big sites, has a comment section that is almost completely run by trolls. It takes actions to combat that, such as the burying and promoting of certain comments, but this new email alert system will bypass that.]]></description>

Sure you do. You know, &#8220;FIRST&#8221;, &#8220;LOLZ&#8221;, &#8220;URGAY&#8221;, etc. Yeah, those guys. Well Digg took a step today that could possibly make them at least 10,000 times more annoying: <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=921">Email alerts</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s be clear: This doesn&#8217;t mean that people who post an item on Digg will get alerts every time someone comments — that would be awful. Instead, this means that if you leave a comment on an item, you will get alerted when someone comments on that. And this will occur only for top-level comments and not nested ones.</p>
<p>And while that may not sound so bad, it&#8217;s no secret that Digg, like many big sites, has a comment section that is almost completely run by trolls. It takes actions to combat that, such as the burying and promoting of certain comments, but this new email alert system will bypass that.</p>
<p>So if I want to leave an insightful comment on Digg, my inbox is now likely to get overwhelmed by the random garbage comments left in response. Sure, some of them may be thoughtful replies, but in my experience, most will be rubbish. And that&#8217;s fine, but just don&#8217;t email them to me. But Digg is, by default.</p>
<p>You can turn the email alerts off <a href="http://digg.com/settings/email">on this page</a>. Or, perhaps even easier, you could just do what plenty of Digg users do, and not comment.</p>

You know how when Maurice in accounting or Lydia on the dev team breaks a hip or has a birthday? And how Sarah in HR goes around collecting cash for a present for them? And how you have to fish out a ten-spot, the same ten-spot you were planning on using for lunch and now you have to use the ATM which isn't your bank and costs $2 to use? And how you're all like "Maybe tomorrow" and Sarah is all like "OK. I'll put you down for tomorrow but I have to go to get the Bed, Bath and Beyond gift certificate tonight so don't forget." And you're all like "Wait, here's ten." And Sarah thinks you're a freak?

Well, Lolligift solves all that. By sending your co-workers <a HREF="http://lolligift.com/pools/213">a single link</a> (I will totally laugh if anyone donates to Nik's fund) they can begin sending cash. You then collect the funds via Paypal (less $5 and Paypal's cut) or request a free mailed check or Visa Check Card. You can overnight the check for $19.95.

<p>The site is run by former Microsoft employees who, I&#8217;m sure, had to put a lot of cash into Bill Gates&#8217; annual birthday Lamborghini pool and therefore have extended experience in the &#8220;giving at the office&#8221; field. Presumably they&#8217;re making their money on holding the deposited cash in a bank account and on the $5 fees.</p>
<p>Founders Adam Sheppard and William Lai is part of the <a HREF="http://8ninths.com/">8ninths incubator</a> in Seattle. It&#8217;s privately held and funded.</p>
<p>As you see it&#8217;s simple to create a pool for almost anything. You enter the recipient, the gift, and then event time. The site then emails the participants.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scaledlolly2-2_jpg.jpg"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scaledlolly2-2_jpg.jpg" alt="scaledlolly2-2_jpg" title="scaledlolly2-2_jpg" width="630" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-88291" /></a></p>
<p>Like <a HREF="http://www.evite.com">evite</a>, <a HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a> and <a HREF="http://www.socializr.com/">socializer</a> and all of those party invite systems you&#8217;ll use this site rarely but once you realize it&#8217;s there, you&#8217;ll probably keep using it. However it does make it much harder to skip out on office gift pools.</p>

The conventional wisdom out there on Web video advertising is that most advertisers don't want to risk being associated with user-generated videos (i.e., the vast bulk of videos on YouTube).  It is only the professionally-produced stuff on portions of YouTube and Hulu and Blip.tv where the advertising dollars are going.  This is the conventional wisdom because it is mostly true.

But YouTube wants to change advertiser's minds (because the vast bulk of its videos are audience-produced, did we mention that?).  So in a <a href=" http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-now-pronounce-you-monetized-youtube.html">blog post</a> today, YouTube trots out a told-ya-so case study about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94JhLEiN0">"JK Wedding Entrance Video" </a> (embedded below) that has been spreading around like crazy.  Since it was posted on July 19, it has been watched more than 12 million times.  ]]></description>

<p>The conventional wisdom out there on Web video advertising is that most advertisers don&#8217;t want to risk being associated with user-generated videos (i.e., the vast bulk of videos on YouTube).  It is only the professionally-produced stuff on portions of YouTube and Hulu and Blip.tv where the advertising dollars are going.  This is the conventional wisdom because it is mostly true.</p>
<p>But YouTube wants to change advertiser&#8217;s minds (because the vast bulk of its videos are audience-produced, did we mention that?).  So in a <a href=" http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-now-pronounce-you-monetized-youtube.html">blog post</a> today, YouTube trots out a told-ya-so case study about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94JhLEiN0">&#8220;JK Wedding Entrance Video&#8221; </a> (embedded below) that has been spreading around like crazy.  Since it was posted on July 19, it has been watched more than 12 million times.  It&#8217;s even spawned its own (professionally-produced) faux sequel, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbr2ao86ww0">JK Divorce Entrance Dance&#8221;</a> (also embedded below).</p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t seen it, the original video shows an entire wedding party boogieing down the aisle in Minnesota.  Instead of a traditional wedding march, the couple picked Chris Brown&#8217;s &#8220;Forever.&#8221;  YouTube&#8217;s content fingerprinting system picked that up and the copyright holders were able to place <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/07/still-searching-for-a-video-business-model-google-introduces-the-youtubevertorial/">click-to-buy ads </a>on the video which linked to downloads of the song on iTunes and Amazon.  </p>
<p>YouTube reports that the click-through rate on those ads was two times higher than the overall click-through rate for those types of ads on the site, and that there was even a spillover effect on official &#8220;Forever&#8221; music video, which also saw the click-through rate son the same ads go up 2.5 times the average.  (It makes sense that would be higher since people going to the official video presumably are more interested in the song itself).  </p>
<p>Not only that, but &#8220;Forever&#8221; climbed the music charts, reaching the No. 4 spot <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/top-100/songs/">on iTunes</a> (it is now No. 15) and No. 3 spot on Amazon&#8217;s MP3 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/dmusic/digital-music-track/ref=pd_ts_dmusic_nav">top seller&#8217;s list</a> (it is currently No. 4).  Not bad for a song that was released a year ago.</p>
<p>YouTube presents this as proof that advertising works on viral videos even if they are audience produced.  I&#8217;m not sure it proves anything other than that breakout videos are good advertising vehicles no matter where they come from.  But YouTube needs to sell more of its video inventory to get to profitability, and the bulk of it is . . . </p>

But a new feature is fairly awesome. "TV" allows you to easily share video clips, just as you would share links on FriendFeed or Redux's main Stream area.

Officially, Redux says it's a "personalized entertainment guide to the web." But really, that's what most social sites are these days. We need new features to distinguish them. And solid usability. And that's what Redux offers in this video area.

The main problem I have with online video is that there's way too much of it. I visit YouTube, but I have no idea what to watch. If I try to browse random videos, most of it is crap, and really, it's just a waste of my time to do that. Most of the videos I consume, friends send me, and that's exactly the idea behind Redux's video area.

<p>The main problem I have with online video is that there&#8217;s way too much of it. I visit YouTube, but I have no idea what to watch. If I try to browse random videos, most of it is crap, and really, it&#8217;s just a waste of my time to do that. Most of the videos I consume, friends send me, and that&#8217;s exactly the idea behind Redux&#8217;s video area. (Finding and consuming videos in a stream is also the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/24/our-first-taste-of-magma/">idea behind Magma</a>, which is still in private beta).  But because it&#8217;s an actual video player, the sharing and watching of videos is seamless.</p>
<p>You go to the area and you are served up videos that your friends have liked (or, given &#8220;props&#8221; to, in their words). If you like the video too, you can mark it as such, and it will send it to your other friends. You can also comment on the video, right from the player.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting here trying to write this post, but I find myself lost in video watching now, it&#8217;s quite addictive. Sure, FriendFeed and other services allow you to share videos and watch them from within the service, but the way Redux does it is much nicer, and makes it easier to lose yourself in the content.</p>
<p>The idea behind all of this is a larger one. &#8220;In 2-3 years when we turn on our TV we&#8217;ll have the same content discovery problem,&#8221; Redux co-founder <span class="gI">David McIntosh tells us. The site has been around for about 5 months now in private testing. So far, there are over 5,000 users, but now it&#8217;s time to expand. </span></p>
<p><span class="gI">As such Redux is making 500 invites available to TechCrunch readers. Simply <a href="http://www.redux.com/signup/tc">follow this link</a> to sign up.</span></p>
<p><span class="gI">So what&#8217;s the business model behind all of this? Well, it&#8217;s two-fold. First, there will eventually be video advertisements placed in the video section. The other idea is based around micropayments. Say you like the show Mad Men, and only want to see content related to it, you could pay a small fee and get access to just that content. There is also the possibility of using micropayments to give users &#8220;super prop&#8221; privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="gI">Right now the video clips only include YouTube, but we&#8217;re told additional services will be added in the future.<br />

The service is already running into frustrating <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">opposition</a> from Apple and possibly AT&#038;T (depending on who you believe). Today, it's getting opposition of a different kind: <a href="http://www.3jam.com">3jam</a>, a company that until now has primarily offered services that revolve around SMS messaging, is expanding to offer telephony services that will be going head to head against Google Voice.



3jam offers many of the same core features offered by Google Voice, including the ability to have one phone number ring multiple phones, as well as an online interface for managing voicemail and text messages, though there are some more advanced features that it lacks (more on that later).  But it does have a few features that Google Voice doesn't, like the ability to receive calls on Skype, AOL, and Yahoo Messenger (why waste minutes when you're sitting in front your your computer anyway?)]]></description>

The service is already running into frustrating <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">opposition</a> from Apple and possibly AT&#038;T (depending on who you believe). Today, it&#8217;s getting opposition of a different kind: <a href="http://www.3jam.com">3jam</a>, a company that until now has primarily offered services that revolve around SMS messaging, is expanding to offer telephony services that will be going head to head against Google Voice.</p>
<p>3jam offers many of the same core features offered by Google Voice, including the ability to have one phone number ring multiple phones, as well as an online interface for managing voicemail and text messages, though there are some more advanced features that it lacks (more on that later).  But it does have a few features that Google Voice doesn&#8217;t, like the ability to receive calls on Skype, AOL, and Yahoo Messenger (why waste minutes when you&#8217;re sitting in front your your computer anyway?)</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3jam1.png"/></p>
<p>3jam also has some impressive SMS functionality, which makes sense given the company&#8217;s history with SMS.  One of these is a group SMS chat, that lets you designate a new phone number as a &#8216;group number&#8217; and then pick out which of your contacts is in your group.  Every time someone within the group sends a message to that number, it will be sent to everyone else in the group as well.  Outsiders can attempt to send messages to the special number, but it won&#8217;t have any effect.</p>
<p>3jam is also trying to tackle one of the biggest problems facing Google Voice: number portability, which allows you to transfer your current phone number to the new service.  We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/google-voices-secret-weapon-number-portability/">heard</a> that Google is trying to work out the details to get his feature out the door some time this year, but it poses many logistical problems.  For one, users could potentially cancel their carrier contracts on accident, leading to hefty fees.  And the wait to get a number transfered from the carrier to the service can take weeks.  But that isn&#8217;t stopping 3jam.  The company is letting users transfer their numbers despite these hurdles, though users will be warned that the process may take as long as 45 days.  </p>
<p>So 3jam has some things going for it, but it still lags behind Google Voice in some key areas. 3jam lacks many of Google Voice&#8217;s more advanced features, like call filtering options — Google Voice lets you set up lists of users and filter calls accordingly (for example I could send certain people straight to voicemail after 6PM but let my family call me at any time), while 3jam doesn&#8217;t offer any similar features.  And 3jam costs money, with plans starting at around $5 a month (Google Voice is free for most features).</p>
<p>Of course, the market for this kind of service is huge, so 3jam may have a chance even with Google Voice in the same space, but it still has many obstacles ahead. The concept is still quite novel to most people, and some may resist putting their telephony service in the hands of a startup.  And 3Jam is going to have to face the same problems Google has when it tries to bring its service to smartphone handsets, though carriers may be less intimated by a startup than they are of Google.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, 3jam is off to a fairly good start.  The company is offereing a white label product that has been licensed by <a href="http://www.getpeek.com/">Peek</a>, a company that makes small mobile communication devices.  Now for the bigger challenge: getting normal people to understand and sign up for the service.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-416-215x143.png" width="215" height="143" />We've all seen the ads and screenshots that pop-up when you hover over keywords on blogs. For the most part, they're annoying. But what if those pop-ups had actual useful information in them? That's the idea behind <a href="http://www.panels.net/">Panels Network</a>.

A key feature of these overlays is that they're not just about links, they also pop-up over ads. So, for example, when you hover over a 125x125 ad on TechCrunch (see an example on <a href="http://panels.net/demo/techcrunch/">this demo page</a>), you can find out information about the advertiser. Think of them as kind of like an excerpt from Wikipedia about the company.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88183" title="picture-416" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-416.png" alt="picture-416" width="337" height="225" />We&#8217;ve all seen the ads and screenshots that pop-up when you hover over keywords on blogs. For the most part, they&#8217;re annoying. But what if those pop-ups had actual useful information in them? That&#8217;s the idea behind <a href="http://www.panels.net/">Panels Network</a>.</p>
<p>A key feature of these overlays is that they&#8217;re not just about links, they also pop-up over ads. So, for example, when you hover over a 125&#215;125 ad on TechCrunch (see an example on <a href="http://panels.net/demo/techcrunch/">this demo page</a>), you can find out information about the advertiser. Think of them as kind of like an excerpt from Wikipedia about the company.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just standard information about the company. These panels also house screenshots of the company&#8217;s website, a map of where they are located, any recent news about the company, job listings, financial news, reviews, and also the ability to shop (if applicable). And the panels remember what section you last clicked on, so the information you find most relevant will always be front and center.</p>
<p>The idea is to make the ads more useful, by giving more information about the companies. As a result of this, they&#8217;re seeing a 50% to 500% increase in click-throughs, Panels Network CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/craig-barnes">Craig Barnes</a> tells us.</p>
<p>So how does Panels make money off of any of this? Well, the idea at first is advertising. Around 20% of Panels are taken up by contextual ads. But eventually, the company has more elaborate plans, including possibly working with companies to tailor their own panels, and control the way they are shown on other sites.</p>
<p>The service, opening in beta today, will be free, at least initially. But the company is being selective for who they will let in at first, with only a few hundred users being allowed to sign up. Installing the panels on your site is as easy as placing a line of code on the page.</p>
<p>Down the line, Panels Network also hopes to make an iPhone app with the same information you see in the panels. The idea there is to get users used to the idea of the information found in the panels.</p>
<p>The Portland, Oregon-based company has raised $2.5 million from Barnes as well as several angel investors, so far.</p>

It enables you to collect all your social and contact accounts - on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and any other network - in one spot. However, the twist was that you could share them in real life with people you met over the mobile web or their "Connector", the USB product they also sell. Today they've <a href="http://www.mynameise.com/iphoneapp">released an app</a> for the iPhone which lets you share your card with the flick of your iPhone-holding hand. Could this be the final death of the business card? I doubt it, but this is going to be a pretty interesting product to watch.

The Connector is not dissimilar to <a href="http://Doyoupoken.com">Poken</a> in some respect, but as well as the wireless USB device it also lets you exchange cards between any mobile via the mobile web. The new iPhone application allows card sharing through a simple flick of the wrist towards another iPhone with the app. E then connect both users and make sure they get automatically connected on the selected social networks as well.]]></description>

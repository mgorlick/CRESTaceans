Just read what Lance Armstrong <a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/2878598422">has</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/2878615861">say</a> about <a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong/status/2878776576">his</a> Tour de France-winning teammate, Alberto Contador. And in the tech world, we have some good smack talking from Verizon directed at rival AT&amp;T today.</p>
<p>John Czwartacki, who is the policy blog editor for Verizon, sent the following <a href="http://twitter.com/CZ/status/2881325142">public message</a> on Twitter, &#8220;<em>This what USA&#8217;s most reliable wireless network sends BEFORE a conference. #VDC</em>&#8220;— complete with <a href="http://twitpic.com/bvs3o">a TwitPic</a> (below) of a giant Verizon truck parked outside the conference to bolster signal.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t mention AT&amp;T specifically, but he doesn&#8217;t have to. His next tweet repeats the message, but <a href="http://twitter.com/CZ/status/2881350461">directed</a> at me. Clearly he&#8217;s been reading  our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rants against</a> AT&amp;T&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">poor service</a>, most recently about AT&amp;T <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/video-att-iphone-hell/">having problems</a> during Comic-Con in San Diego.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, AT&amp;T reached out to me the other day saying it felt that it did a good job handling the onslaught of Comic-Con traffic on day 2. Of course, that still doesn&#8217;t speak to why it was bad on day one, when the company undoubtedly knew they were going to see a surge of usage. And that&#8217;s what Verizon&#8217;s tweet speaks to, nipping problems in the butt before they become problems. Judging from SXSW and Comic-Con, apparently that&#8217;s too much to ask from AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has been a trending topic on Twitter multiple times over the past few weeks — and never for a good reason. Verizon is just the latest to jump on the bandwagon of trashing the service on Twitter. Will AT&amp;T respond? Can it?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-551-182x200.png" width="182" height="200" />Earlier today we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">learned</a> that Apple had begun to pull all Google Voice-enabled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">applications</a> from the App Store, citing the fact that they "duplicate features that come with the iPhone".  Now comes even worse news: we've learned that Apple has blocked Google's official Google Voice application itself from the App Store.  In other words, Google Voice — one of the best things to happen to telephony services in a <i>very</i> long time — will have no presence at all on the App Store.  If there's ever been a time to be furious with Apple, now is it.

A Google Spokesperson has told us the following:


<blockquote>We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone.  Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store.  We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users -- for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.</blockquote>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-551.png" class="shot2"/>Earlier today we <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">learned</a> that Apple had begun to pull all Google Voice-enabled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">applications</a> from the App Store, citing the fact that they &#8220;duplicate features that come with the iPhone&#8221;.  Now comes even worse news: we&#8217;ve learned that Apple has blocked Google&#8217;s official Google Voice application itself from the App Store.  In other words, Google Voice — one of the best things to happen to telephony services in a <i>very</i> long time — will have no presence at all on the App Store.  If there&#8217;s ever been a time to be furious with Apple, now is it.</p>
<p>A Google Spokesperson has told us the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone.  Apple did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store.  We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users &#8212; for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not hard to guess who&#8217;s behind the restriction: our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">old friend</a> AT&#038;T.  Google Voice scares the carriers.  It allows users to send free SMS messages and get cheap long-distance over Google Voice&#8217;s lines.  It also makes it trivial to switch to a new phone service, because everyone calls the Google Voice number anyway.  Carriers have known about Google Voice for a long time, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that it began accepting new users, and there has still been some hassle associated with actually using the service.  Smartphone apps like GV Mobile remove many of those hassles, which is why AT&#038;T is keen to keep them off the iPhone (Google already has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">official</a> apps available for BlackBerry and Android).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another testament to just how ridiculous this move is: GV Mobile&#8217;s developer Sean Kovacs <a href="http://twitter.com/seankovacs/status/2876599172">says that</a> the app was personally approved last April by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Phil Schiller</a>, Apple&#8217;s senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing — the man who often takes the stage during Apple keynotes when Steve Jobs isn&#8217;t around.  Kovacs says that Schiller called him to personally apologize for the delay in initially getting the application approved.  Now, I&#8217;m sure Apple has laid out in its terms of service somewhere that you&#8217;re not allowed to mimic the iPhone&#8217;s functionality.  But when you&#8217;ve got a blessing from that high up, that would seem like a pretty good indication that the application belongs in the App Store.</p>
<p>The thing that really bothers me about the move is that Apple is now actively stifling innovation.  Google Voice is the kind of service that can actually have a positive impact on your life, and not in a frivolous, entertainment-related sense.  It makes it easier to connect with people, and to manage those connections.  Apple can point to the App Store&#8217;s 50,000 applications all it wants, but how many of them could truly be called groundbreaking?  Are they really putting a dent in the universe? </p>
<p>All the more upsetting is that this comes from the company that Steve Jobs built. The company that once made record labels bow to a flat 0.99 pricing structure for years longer than they would have liked is now screwing customers because AT&#038;T asked them to.  They&#8217;re trying to limit what I can and can&#8217;t run on my mobile phone — a phone whose marketing is largely based on its extensibility.</p>
<p>Back when the App Store first launched there were some warnings about its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/24/apples-app-store-the-new-walled-garden/">walled garden</a> approach — could developers trust Apple to maintain a fair marketplace?  Until recently, Apple has managed the store in a generally benevolent,  if not somewhat <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/22/feel-like-shaking-a-baby-to-death-theres-an-app-for-that/">incompetent</a> manner.  But now things are taking a turn for the worse.  From a handicapped <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10239277-37.html">Sling</a> app to blocked apps from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/qik-brings-live-video-to-the-iphone-3gs-but-you-still-wont-find-it-in-the-app-store/">Qik</a> and Google Voice, it&#8217;s becoming clear that Apple is doing its best to keep many of the iPhone&#8217;s most game-changing apps <i>away</i> from users.  Palm, if you&#8217;re looking for marketing material — take note.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tony-hsieh-215x147.jpg" width="215" height="147" />If Zappos was a<a href="http://www.pehub.com/45388/zappos-ceo-wanted-to-stay-independent-sequoia-wanted-liquidity%E2%80%94sources/"> forced sale</a>, would someone please come force me a raise?

Zappos just  filed its <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&#38;p=irol-SECText&#38;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2NjYm4uMTBrd2l6YXJkLmNvbS94bWwvZmlsaW5nLnhtbD9yZXBvPXRlbmsmaXBhZ2U9NjQzMjk5MCZhdHRhY2g9T04mc1hCUkw9MQ%3d%3d">S4</a> with the Securities &#38; Exchange Commission, which details the history of the merger talks with Amazon. There's a lot of boring boilerplate here, but one of the more interesting bits is on page 68, where there's a confusing breakdown of Zappos' ownership.

The percentages appear to add up to way over 100% because the shares of Venture Frogs are essentially counted three times. Venture Frogs was the firm Zappos CEO and CFO Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin used to own that first invested in Zappos back in 1999. Because either of them "could" contol the voting shares, the SEC counts each of the shares under their names, as well as under the Venture Frogs name.

But once you back that out, one thing is clear: No one could sell the company without the blessing of Hsieh and Lin.

<p>Zappos just  filed its <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2NjYm4uMTBrd2l6YXJkLmNvbS94bWwvZmlsaW5nLnhtbD9yZXBvPXRlbmsmaXBhZ2U9NjQzMjk5MCZhdHRhY2g9T04mc1hCUkw9MQ%3d%3d">S4</a> with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, which details the history of the merger talks with Amazon. There&#8217;s a lot of boring boilerplate here, but one of the more interesting bits is on page 68, where there&#8217;s a confusing breakdown of Zappos&#8217; ownership.</p>
<p>The percentages appear to add up to way over 100% because the shares of Venture Frogs are essentially counted three times. Venture Frogs was the firm Zappos CEO and CFO Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin used to own that first invested in Zappos back in 1999. Because either of them &#8220;could&#8221; contol the voting shares, the SEC counts each of the shares under their names, as well as under the Venture Frogs name.</p>
<p>But once you back that out, one thing is clear: No one could sell the company without the blessing of Hsieh and Lin. CEO Hsieh owns 29.4% of the common shares, CFO Lin owns another 2.7% and Venture Frogs&#8211; the firm they started and jointly manage&#8211; owns another 39.9% of the shares.</p>
<p>Sequoia owned 22% of the company, but made different returns depending on the liquidation preferences in each term sheet. In all, the firm is poised to make a return of roughly $160 million, based on Amazon&#8217;s closing price today. Sequoia invested $35 million over the companies E and F rounds. Not bad.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much harder to see how much Hsieh and Lin are making, because no one knows how much of the proceeds of the Venture Frogs shares goes to their pockets or to their LPs. But they clearly did well. Hsieh made at least $214 million; Lin made at least $18 million, with the Venture Frogs shares netting an additional $163 million. If that&#8217;s a forced sale, the two are crying all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>Another shocker from the S4: Zappos&#8217; revenues. We&#8217;re so used to that $1 billion-in-gross-merchandise-sales figure being bandied about that people tend to confuse that with Zappos&#8217; <em>actual sales</em>. But that number doesn&#8217;t count returns, which can be as high as 40% according to people close to the company. The real sales from 2008 were $635 million, up from $527 million in 2007. In the first quarter of 2009, Zappos grew revenues at a clip of 8%.</p>
<p>So while you can argue Amazon still got a great deal; Hsieh and Lin did pretty well too. That makes it all the more impressive that they&#8217;re sticking around to keep growing the company rather than heading to a remote beach.</p>

Google finally sold back its 5 percent stake in AOL to Time Warner.  Originally valued at $1 billion in 2005, Google ended up <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">getting back only $283 million</a>, including some cash distributions.  There goes roughly $700 million, but Google already <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">took a writedown</a> on the investment back in the fourth quarter when the whole world was going to pot and nobody really noticed.

Time Warner took back the shares in preparation for the eventual <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/time-warner-to-decide-on-aol-spinoff-at-thursday-board-meeting-its-a-done-deal/">public spinoff of AOL</a>.  When Google initially bought the shares, it valued AOL at $20 billion.  Based on the price Time Warner paid for the repurchase of the shares, AOL is now worth $5.7 billion.

<p>Google finally sold back its 5 percent stake in AOL to Time Warner.  Originally valued at $1 billion in 2005, Google ended up <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">getting back only $283 million</a>, including some cash distributions.  There goes roughly $700 million, but Google already <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aAW086q8OzJ4">took a writedown</a> on the investment back in the fourth quarter when the whole world was going to pot and nobody really noticed.</p>
<p>Time Warner took back the shares in preparation for the eventual <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/time-warner-to-decide-on-aol-spinoff-at-thursday-board-meeting-its-a-done-deal/">public spinoff of AOL</a>.  When Google initially bought the shares, it valued AOL at $20 billion.  Based on the price Time Warner paid for the repurchase of the shares, AOL is now worth $5.7 billion.  I&#8217;m sure by the time it actually goes public, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/google-ad-chief-tim-armstrong-replaces-randy-falco-as-chairman-and-ceo-of-aol/">new CEO Tim Armstrong</a> and AOL&#8217;s bankers are going to be arguing that it is worth a lot more.</p>
<p>So did Google get hosed on this investment?  Pretty much.  But you have to remember that it was part of a larger search outsourcing deal which Google still makes money from today.  AOL on its own commands a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/bing-gains-some-search-share-from-yahoo/">3 percent</a> search market share and as such is probably Google&#8217;s largest partner site.  Even if Google didn&#8217;t make back its investment over the past four years, the search volume AOL provides itself is worth paying for.  (Search is a volume game, the more search queries you can throw ads against, the better the ROI).  So don&#8217;t feel too bad for Google.  It was buying distribution which helped it maintain its overall market dominance.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/img_5-215x188.jpg" width="215" height="188" />Last week, we wrote about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/bing-twitter-and-a-backpack-full-of-cash-hopefully-for-beer/">Bing Cashback contest</a> that rewards Bing searchers with a chance to win a $500 gift card. Well, the contest is in full swing, and if today is any indication, to win, you don't even need to have the correct answer.

Today's question was: "<em>Bing #cashbackpack Trivia: What Bing cashback percentage does drugstore.com offer?</em>" To find the answer, simply search for something like "“drugstore.com bing cash back” on Bing, and you'll <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=“drugstore.com+bing+cash+back”&#38;go=&#38;form=QBLH&#38;qs=n">see the sponsored result</a> right at the top.

The answer? 20%. The problem? The winner <a href="http://twitter.com/hussain_sattu/status/2874025319">said</a> 10%.]]></description>

Well, the contest is in full swing, and if today is any indication, to win, you don&#8217;t even need to have the correct answer.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s question was: &#8220;<em>Bing #cashbackpack Trivia: What Bing cashback percentage does drugstore.com offer?</em>&#8221; To find the answer, simply search for something like &#8220;“drugstore.com bing cash back” on Bing, and you&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=“drugstore.com+bing+cash+back”&amp;go=&amp;form=QBLH&amp;qs=n">see the sponsored result</a> right at the top.</p>
<p>The answer? 20%. The problem? The winner <a href="http://twitter.com/hussain_sattu/status/2874025319">said</a> 10%.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t stop the Bing Cashback account from <a href="http://twitter.com/bingcashback/status/2877349420">tweeting out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bing #cashbackpack Trivia: Congrats @hussain_sattu -today&#8217;s lucky winner for the $500 cash card in the Bing backpack!</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what else is odd. The winner follows one user on Twitter, Bing Cashback. And they have a total of 4 tweets, 3 of which are for the Cashback content (and the other is &#8220;studying&#8221; — this contest is supposed to be for students). This is leading some to question if the entire thing isn&#8217;t rigged, or at the very least being gamed. Regardless, one thing seems very clear: Whoever is running the contest for Microsoft isn&#8217;t paying too much attention.</p>
<p>The contest is kind of a joke anyway. Once someone goes out and finds the answer, it looks like a bunch of other Twitter users are just repeating it, to try and win.</p>
<p>What an awesome contest. I think I&#8217;ll play tomorrow. When they ask for the correct cashback percentage for some website, my answer will be &#8220;watermelon.&#8221; I&#8217;m so gonna win that $500.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Now Bing is <a href="http://twitter.com/bingcashback/status/2877981444">saying</a> that on a sub-site, 10% was listed for whatever reason, so it accepted that answer along with the 20% answer. May want to get those promotions in line Bing.</p>

It was arguing that social gaming company <a href="http://www.zynga.com">Zynga</a> could be breaking multiple state and federal anti-gambling laws via its popular Texas HoldEm game.

A few things are striking about this. First off, Zynga is one a handful of companies building Facebook and iPhone apps that has found a way to make money. Lots of money. Close to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2009/tc20090429_963394.htm">$200 hundred millions dollars in revenues</a> to be precise. The fact that it could be the next target for an overzealous state attorney is a big story in and of itself. Second, the fact that competitors are this threatened by Zynga’s cash machine shows an ugly battle royale brewing in the application space. (More on that in a bit.)

Online gambling is illegal, according to the U.S. State Department and a handful of states, but there are still some gray areas. In June, the Feds started <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4338365http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4338365">cracking down on gamblers</a> in an attempt to clear things up. Meanwhile, others like Massachusetts representative Barney Frank are seeking to legalize and tax the $1 billion or more in annual revenues U.S. poker players are mostly sending to sites based overseas. Frank clearly faces a huge uphill battle from religious groups who see poker as a moral issue.

But a site like Zynga should be able to side-step all of this, because although you can buy chips for Zynga's Texas HoldEm game you can't redeem them for money, right? Maybe not.]]></description>

<p>A few things are striking about this. First off, Zynga is one a handful of companies building Facebook and iPhone apps that has found a way to make money. Lots of money.

<p>Online gambling is illegal, according to the U.S. State Department and a handful of states, but there are still some gray areas. In June, the Feds started <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4338365http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4338365">cracking down on gamblers</a> in an attempt to clear things up. Meanwhile, others like Massachusetts representative Barney Frank are seeking to legalize and tax the $1 billion or more in annual revenues U.S. poker players are mostly sending to sites based overseas. Frank clearly faces a huge uphill battle from religious groups who see poker as a moral issue.</p>
<p>But a site like Zynga should be able to side-step all of this, because although you can buy chips for Zynga&#8217;s Texas HoldEm game you can&#8217;t redeem them for money, right? Maybe not.</p>
<p>According to the brief, the issue boils down to three factors:</p>
<div>• Is the activity otherwise authorized?</div>
<div>• Is poker a game of chance, as opposed to a game of skill?</div>
<div>• Does the user bet/win something of value?</div>
<p>The answers to the first two are pretty clear—and not contested by Zynga. Poker is clearly considered gambling in the offline world, and poker specifically has been proven in New York State court to be a game of chance not skill in the case of <em>New York v. Turner</em>. That decision read: “Games of chance range from those that require no skill, such as a lottery…to those such as poker, blackjack which require considerable skill in calculating the probability of drawing particular cards. Nonetheless, the latter are as much games of chance as the former, since the outcome depends to a material degree upon the random distribution of cards.”</p>
<p>The third question is where things get murky. Zynga liberally gives people free chips every time they log in. But you can also buy chips. That constitutes the user betting something of value. So what about the outcome? Do users win something of value?</p>
<p>A prosecutor could argue a few angles here: Within the game, there’s the case that the chips are of value because they can be used to buy virtual gifts for others or that extended game play and privileges given to players who win more chips constitutes something of value. There’s some precedent under New York State law (specifically entailing poker machines in <em>Plato’<span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6849" class="Object">s Cave Corporation</span> v. State Liquor Authority</em>) showing that continued play constitutes something of value. But Zynga could easily argue that there are so many opportunities for continued free play and so many free chips given away at every log in that players clearly aren’t motivated to win because of material gains.</p>
<p>The one place where Zynga chips do have a clear material value is on illegal secondary markets where chips are regularly bought and sold, and because Zynga allows Facebook friends to send chips to each other transferring chips to a black-market buyer isn&#8217;t hard. (Zynga only allows you to gift 100 chips per day, so it is time-consuming.) The brief argues that these illegal markets are readily found with a Google search and that “While Zynga does not support the black market, an argument could be made that they profit from it and do so knowingly.”</p>
<p>Zynga takes issue with that and argues that it has gone to great lengths to squash the secondary market for chips and enforce its Terms of Service. Zynga has filed numerous cease and desist letters to sites and ISPs, has taken down sites by enforcing legal protections surrounding its own copyrights and trademarks, daily monitors the Web looking for these illegitimate sites, worked with payment processors like PayPal to accelerate the take down of these sites and filed numerous legal actions.</p>
<p>There’s a demonstrable paper trail showing Zynga’s efforts to clamp down on these secondary markets. Cases have included: <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Phillip Labrasca</em> / Complaint Filed <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6850" class="Object">July 1, 2009</span>, <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Duc Doan</em> /  Complaint Filed <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6851" class="Object">July 1, 2009</span>, <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Carmi Solak</em> / Complaint Filed <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6852" class="Object">July 14, 2009</span>, <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Jason McCann</em> / Complaint Filed: <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6853" class="Object">July 14, 2009</span>, <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Chris Sim II</em> / Complaint Filed <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6854" class="Object">July 14, 2009</span> and <em>Zynga Game Network, Inc. v. Moss Brothers</em> / Complaint Filed <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT6855" class="Object">July 14, 2009</span>.</p>
<p>This all raises the question: Why doesn&#8217;t  Zynga just turn-off the ability to gift friends chips? I expect if prosecutors started to seriously circle, the company would shut it down.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hardly a slam dunk that Zynga is breaking the law and a stretch to say going after them is in the public&#8217;s interest. The Feds certainly have much more explicit examples of online gambling to focus on first. But could I see an over-zealous legislator or state attorney general bringing a case against them for political reasons? Absolutely. These are people who believe that online dating sites lead to rape, MySpace leads to pedophilia and Twitter leads to terrorism. Crazier claims have certainly been made than saying a game called “poker” could be encouraging online gambling. And while you can argue that World of Warcraft, Second Life or any game operating in the virtual goods economy has the same issues, a game called poker would likely be a clearer target.</p>
<p>Now, back to the competitor who leaked us the brief. The person called the meeting under the condition of anonymity, so I can’t divulge who it was. But the source argued they commissioned the brief because they too had thought of building poker applications, having watched Zynga’s success and wanted to see if there would be legal implications down the line. The findings were enough to scare them away from it. The competitor then decided to leak it because it thought it was unfair that Zynga was using potentially illegal revenues to its own competitive advantage in other applications like Mafia Wars. The competitor alleged that Zynga spends some <strong>$500,000</strong> a week on Facebook ads and another <strong>$2</strong> million to <strong>$3</strong> million per month on MySpace advertising.</p>
<p>Whether you find the leak a savvy or slimy business move, it was certainly ballsy: If Zynga is called out it will have a chilling effect on the entire virtual goods space which appears to be one of the most lucrative business models going on the Web.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was disappointed that Zynga chief executive Mark Pincus refused to address the claims on the record. I have a huge amount of respect for Pincus and as such gave him every opportunity, including sharing the brief itself nearly a week before publication of this post. The brief raises legitimate questions and if Zynga really believes its operating in the clear, why not just say so on the record?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/googvoicegvmobile-132x200.png" width="132" height="200" />Google Voice is a pretty amazing service, but it comes with a number of minor annoyances, including the way in handles outgoing calls and SMS messages.  Fortunately, Google has recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">come out</a> with a number of smartphone apps for BlackBerry and Android that obviate the need for any extra steps, making Google Voice a natural replacement for your phone's native dialer.  The iPhone still lacks an official client, but that hasn't stopped a handful of third party developers from releasing their own apps, which have been available on the App Store for the last few months.  Today, however, it sounds like Apple has made the decision to crack down on these: Sean Kovacs, the developer behind the popular app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=309836317&#038;mt=8">GV Mobile</a>, has <a href="http://www.seankovacs.com/index.php/2009/07/gv-mobile-is-getting-pulled-from-app-store/#comments">written</a> on his blog that Apple is going to be removing his application, citing the fact that it "duplicates features that come with the iPhone".

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/googvoicegvmobile.png" class="shot2"/>Google Voice is a pretty amazing service, but it comes with a number of minor annoyances, including the way in handles outgoing calls and SMS messages.  Fortunately, Google has recently <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">come out</a> with a number of smartphone apps for BlackBerry and Android that obviate the need for any extra steps, making Google Voice a natural replacement for your phone&#8217;s native dialer.  The iPhone still lacks an official client, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped a handful of third party developers from releasing their own apps, which have been available on the App Store for the last few months.  Today, however, it sounds like Apple has made the decision to crack down on these: Sean Kovacs, the developer behind the popular app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=309836317&#038;mt=8">GV Mobile</a>, has <a href="http://www.seankovacs.com/index.php/2009/07/gv-mobile-is-getting-pulled-from-app-store/#comments">written</a> on his blog that Apple is going to be removing his application, citing the fact that it &#8220;duplicates features that come with the iPhone&#8221;.</p>
<p>From Kovac&#8217;s blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Chipman from Apple just called - he told me they’re removing GV Mobile from the App Store due to it duplicating features that the iPhone comes with (Dialer, SMS, etc). He didn’t actually specify which features, although I assume the whole app in general. He wouldn’t send a confirmation email either - too scared I would post it.  I’ll see what I can do to get it back up there gang…</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, Apple&#8217;s App Store policies have crossed the line from irritating to totally ridiculous.  GV Mobile taps into a service that is entirely different from the iPhone&#8217;s native dialer, making Google Voice far easier to use than it normally is.  It&#8217;s also laughable that Apple would refuse to specify exactly which features the app was duplicating.</p>
<p>Even more worrying are the implications this would have if it becomes Apple&#8217;s policy to ban Google Voice apps from the App Store, which would strike a major blow to the service.  There is at least one other Google Voice app <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/04/09/battle-of-the-google-voice-iphone-apps-voicecentral-vs-gv-mobile/">already available</a> on the App Store, called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=310081988&#038;mt=8">VoiceCentral</a>, and we&#8217;ve previously <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">confirmed</a> that Google has an official app in the works. <b>Update:</b> VoiceCentral has been removed from the App Store as well. This looks like a store-wide policy change.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible that Apple&#8217;s decision to ban the app is being driven not by user confusion, but by AT&#038;T&#8217;s request.  Google Voice is very powerful, and is only becoming increasingly so as it releases new apps and features that make it easier to use.  It also hits the carriers where it hurts, making it easy for users to swap numbers on a whim, get cheap calls, save on SMS, and much more.</p>
<p>And while it would be surprising if Apple blocked Google&#8217;s app from the App Store, it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time Google was forced to bow to Apple&#8217;s wishes — just <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/why-is-google-latitude-a-web-app-and-not-a-native-app-because-apple-said-so/">last week</a> Google had to scrap a native app built for its Latitude service in favor of a web app at Apple&#8217;s request.  Yet another possibility is that Google&#8217;s official application is imminent, and the GV Mobile app was pulled to reduce confusion once that&#8217;s out (though this seems less likely).</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Apple has removed VoiceCentral from the App Store as well.  While both GV Mobile and VoiceCentral still have their profiles available in the store, attempts to buy them results in an error message that they are no longer available.</p>

Well so far Twitter hasn't been <em>that</em> terribly prolific in using the words 'tweet' or 'retweet' apart from some odd blog posts and individual employees' messages on the micro-sharing service. That has changed today.

TechCrunch reader <a href="http://twitter.com/JoeHagofsky">@JoeHagofsky</a> informs us that Twitter has apparently changed the word 'updates' on the right sidebar of the page you see when logged onto its website to 'tweets' (see screenshots below).

<p>Well so far Twitter hasn&#8217;t been <em>that</em> terribly prolific in using the words &#8216;tweet&#8217; or &#8216;retweet&#8217; apart from some odd blog posts and individual employees&#8217; messages on the micro-sharing service. That has changed today.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reader <a href="http://twitter.com/JoeHagofsky">@JoeHagofsky</a> informs us that Twitter has apparently changed the word &#8216;updates&#8217; on the right sidebar of the page you see when logged onto its website to &#8216;tweets&#8217; (see screenshots below). It&#8217;s also changed on individual profile pages. We see them too and as far as we know this is in fact new.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that despite &#8216;updates&#8217; being changed to &#8216;tweets&#8217; in a few places, the big, main button used to send a tweet still reads &#8216;update.&#8217;</p>
<p>Of course, this is a minor update, but in light of the posts linked above it&#8217;s fairly interesting to see the startup actually adopt the word. It&#8217;s been widely reported that Twitter will soon, possibly as early as this week, launch a completely revamped website which could well offer a better experience than the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/tweeting-from-the-web-nine-alternative-web-clients/">slew of third-party web apps</a> out there.</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll see much more use of the word when they do.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-86982" title="pleasantville_photos_352" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/pleasantville_photos_352.jpg" alt="pleasantville_photos_352" width="400" height="266" />While there&#8217;s a lot of talk about Apple&#8217;s rumored tablet device as it relates to new initiatives from the music industry, the device is undoubtedly a lot larger in scope. The music-angle talk is mostly thanks to the Financial Times <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/are-apple-and-the-music-labels-mixing-holiday-cocktails-on-the-tablet/">all-over-the-place</a> first report yesterday. But <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a52c9ec0-7a29-11de-b86f-00144feabdc0.html">a second story</a> also released yesterday with much of the same information, clears things up a bit, and adds a few interesting new nuggets of information.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It would be a colour, flat-panel TV to the old-fashioned, black and white TV of the Kindle,” one publishing executive said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh oh, Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, the executive completely glosses over any upsides to the current Kindle. Like the fact that its E-ink uses very little power. Or that it can be read in sunlight and is easier on the eyes than a backlit screen, which the Apple device would undoubtedly use. But still, it always seemed inevitable that devices like the Kindle would make the transition from black and white to color, just as televisions and iPods did before it. Now it appears Apple is ready to shove the e-book readers into a world of color before they may be ready.</p>
<p>Thought of another way, this new Apple device is kind of like the kids in <em>Pleasantville</em> from the real-world, full-color future who visit the quaint black-and-white fake television town of the 1950s, and turn it on its head. Things could get ugly — but undoubtedly will be more exciting.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-86985" title="zk7xo242" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/zk7xo242.jpg" alt="zk7xo242" width="264" height="384" />I have a Kindle (the 2nd generation), and I love it. But even after months of using it, when I switch to it after a day of using my iPhone, my initial reaction is to try and touch the screen. I want to flick my finger from side to side to turn book pages, not use the device&#8217;s clunky buttons. I want to be able to turn the device and put it into landscape mode, to pinch to zoom in on picture, and for the love of God, please let me use my finger to click on links rather than the awful joystick thing. Those are things that this Apple device will undoubtedly bring to the table.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and you can be sure it will not only play music, but movies as well. And I&#8217;m sure it will browse the web in a way that makes the Kindle really look antiquated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting just how eager the FT report paints book publishers as getting in bed with Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>Book publishers have been in talks with Apple and are optimistic about being included in the computer, which could provide an alternative to Amazon’s Kindle, Sony’s Reader and a forthcoming device from Plastic Logic, recently allied with Barnes &amp; Noble.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, as they note, unlike the music industry, which Apple brought to its knees when it got a dominant position, Amazon, not Apple, is the one that threatens to do the same to the book industry right now. In Apple, they likely see a very viable alternative that should ease fears of Amazon doing something like cutting out the middle man (the publishers) and publishing books itself for the Kindle.</p>
<p>If Apple really is able to get this device out by September — which again, seems unlikely for a few reasons, another of which is that according to this new FT report, Apple hasn&#8217;t even talked to the film studios about it yet — Amazon is going to have to haul ass to get a response out on the market. Could that mean a Kindle 3, in color, by early 2010?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-415-215x97.png" width="215" height="97" />The Internet got in a <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090724/p69#a090724p69">bit of a tizzy</a> this weekend when it was reported that Twitter was banned from being accessed from inside the White House. What is this, Iran, some wondered? But have no fear, despite what White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told C-SPAN, Twitter is apparently not entirely blocked and they're working to open it up more, Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/twitter-not-blocked-in-white-house-as-it-turns-out/">told Mediaite today</a>.

Here's where the confusion apparently comes from. Access to Twitter's website is blocked on most White House computers, but that's only for security and recordkeeping reasons for the time-being. Apparently, the White House is working with the White House counsel and the Office of Administration CIO "to review and relax these restrictions," Burton says. And, more importantly, it is apparently not official policy of the White House that staffers are not allowed to tweet, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mkapor/status/2828348234">some do so</a> from their own web-connected devices.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-86956" title="picture-415" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-415.png" alt="picture-415" width="350" height="158" />The Internet got in a <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090724/p69#a090724p69">bit of a tizzy</a> this weekend when it was reported that Twitter was banned from being accessed from inside the White House. What is this, Iran, some wondered? But have no fear, despite what White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told C-SPAN, Twitter is apparently not entirely blocked and they&#8217;re working to open it up more, Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/twitter-not-blocked-in-white-house-as-it-turns-out/">told Mediaite today</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the confusion apparently comes from. Access to Twitter&#8217;s website is blocked on most White House computers, but that&#8217;s only for security and recordkeeping reasons for the time-being. Apparently, the White House is working with the White House counsel and the Office of Administration CIO &#8220;to review and relax these restrictions,&#8221; Burton says. And, more importantly, it is apparently not official policy of the White House that staffers are not allowed to tweet, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mkapor/status/2828348234">some do so</a> from their own web-connected devices.</p>
<p>And there are computers that can post to Twitter in the White House right now via <a href="http://old.hootsuite.com/">HootSuite</a>, which you see from time to time as the source of official White House tweets. But most of the official White House account tweets are done by the new media team (consisting of Director of New Media Macon Phillips and Online Programs Director Jesse Lee), from the new media offices are in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (which is next door to the White House). President Obama&#8217;s account is apparently handled by the DNC.</p>
<p>So there you go, while it is hard to tweet from inside the White House right now, it&#8217;s not impossible, and they&#8217;re trying to make it easier. It&#8217;s just a matter of recordkeeping and, quite literally, national security right now, which seems understandable.</p>
<p>And the White House wants you to know that it likes Twitter. It tweets about it not once, but twice today. First, to <a href="http://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/2870776229">clear up the banning issue</a>. And second, like a good Twitter user, to promote itself to <a href="http://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/2874012553">try to get a million followers</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, it seems Burton has a good sense of humor about the whole thing. When asked to name some White House staffers that tweet, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have an account that I follow on my personal blackberry but I don’t actually twitter myself. It’s more to keep track of what Diddy and Perez Hilton are up to all day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Admit it: you&#8217;ve been thinking about learning a foreign language. Maybe you&#8217;ve been planning a trip to Mexico or were considering taking over a small, French-speaking colony in the Maldives. Regardless of your interest or your armaments, it&#8217;s always nice to know a foreign language.</p>
<p>Until now the traditional online teaching methods have involved simple flash-card-like exercises and animations aimed at getting you acquainted with a language or, at the very least, CDs running you through the traditional &#8220;I would like to buy some hashish&#8221; and &#8220;My hovercraft is full of eels&#8221; rigmarole we know all too well from learning languages on tape. <a href="http://rosettastone.com">Rosetta Stone</a> aims to change all that with their new TOTALe live language lessons and activities.</p>
<p>Rosetta Stone, a language learning company founded by Allen Stoltzfus in 1992, focused at first on CD-based training and quickly embraced web-based Flash systems for running lessons. The basic kits - about $499 for three lesson levels - include a web-based portion as well as an &#8220;audio companion&#8221; for training away from the PC.</p>
<p>Their new system, called TOTALe, adds two interactive ingredients to the mix. The first is the Rosetta Studio, a live lesson area where you and two other students at your skill level work one-on-one with a live, native speaker.</p>
<p>The second ingredient is Rosetta World, a matching service that connects a native speaker of one language with a learner of the other and, in some cases, vice versa. This means an Italian learning English would be connected with an American learning Italian. They then perform activities or play games related to the subject matter and can chat with each other in their native languages. The World portion also takes advantage of Rosetta Stone&#8217;s extensive network of students who have used other company products in the past, ensuring everyone can be paired up.</p>
<p>The interface is quite simple. After setting up your microphone, the Flash application runs you through standard comprehension lessons and vocabulary. This takes about two hours to complete. Once you&#8217;ve completed a full lesson you can go to an online calendar and schedule a Studio session. The sessions last 50 minutes and involve simple discussion and vocabulary drills, all based on photographs illustrating the lesson.</p>
<p>The whole system is run inside the browser and works on Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The screens are large and easy to read and all of the photography is top notch.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-86830" title="scaledrequirements_jpg" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scaledrequirements_jpg.jpg" alt="scaledrequirements_jpg" width="630" height="354" /></p>
<p><object width="640" height="480" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/dQI8EogiuiA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dQI8EogiuiA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>I ran through some sample lessons in Spanish and found it a great refresher. Considering my High School Spanish has been decimated it was nice to run through the colors and numbers and I got to see my old friends the <em>caballo</em> and the <em>camisa</em> two words I had forgotten entirely. Most of the lessons include a speech portion, allowing you to practice pronunciation as well. I had a bit of trouble with my microphone but it seemed to understand my accented Spanish with ease.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="480" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/l6q8cmzbcG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l6q8cmzbcG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>The Studio session was fun and educational. A charming young lady led us through a series of exercises, asking us questions based on vocabulary we learned in the lessons and asking us to create sentences out of our limited verbiage. You can mark images with arrows and crosses as well as add your own notes to the images. All of the students can hear each other but the coach - or teacher - is there to prevent you guys from making dates or berating the dumb guy in the room (Thanks, Adriana!)</p>
<p>All of this takes time but it seems like time well-spent. I enjoyed the lessons and the Studio session was excellent, giving me an opportunity to speak in Spanish without the pressure of having to perform in real life situations. The company is planning to expand the service to educational institutions, an excellent solution for schools strapped for language educators. By putting a few kids in a room with a live person you create a mini classroom that is, if you think about it, quite amazing.</p>
<p>Now for the bad news: TOTALe will be available on Tuesday and will cost $999 for a twelve month subscription. This includes Studio sessions and you can repeat sessions as necessary. After the introductory period it will cost $1,200.</p>
<p>Before you go clicking off to buy a used copy of &#8220;Farsi for Dummies,&#8221; however, remember that Rosetta Stone has been an effective teaching tool for over two decades. The quality of the lessons is extremely high and the chance to work with a native speaker is unrivaled except in face-to-face schools. This social, human aspect really brings the lessons home and adds an amazing amount of value to the program.</p>
<p>This idea isn&#8217;t new. Sites like <a href="http://www.livemocha.com">LiveMocha</a>, <a href="http://www.babalah.com">Babalah</a>,<a href="http://palabea.com">Palabea</a>,<a href="http://www.busuu.com">Busuu</a>, and <a href="http://www.learn10.com">Learn10</a> are all trying to create similar solutions. However, Rosetta Stone has a bit more budget and experience behind their TOTALe system.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="480" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/G6D1YI-41ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/G6D1YI-41ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>In my own limited experience with the program, it is great for the professional and may be a great way to learn helpful phrases like &#8220;Drop your panties Sir William I cannot﻿ wait &#8217;til lunch time.&#8221; The social aspects alone make the program stand out in a crowded market.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you made it this far into the post you&#8217;re eligible to win <strong>one of ten year-long subscriptions</strong> courtesy of Rosetta Stone. Comment below using your real email address in the correct field and I&#8217;ll pick ten comments at random on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Wright will remain a board member and shareholder of the venture-backed startup, he already has a replacement: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Kunda">Elaine Kunda</a> will take over the reins as CEO from this point forward.</p>
<p>The decision apparently stems from the beginning of this year, when Wright took a short vacation and went offline for about 10 days. He <a href="http://www.ensight.org/2009/07/27/handing-over-the-reins-at-b5media-or-a-year-of-transition/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did it because I was tired, burnt out and recognized that my life wasn’t what I wanted it to be. I was working too much, unhappy at home, unhappy at work and just felt completely blah. Basically I did it because a friend asked me what I wanted my life to be… It was then  that I realized not only was I unhappy, but that I had no idea what I wanted my life to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wright&#8217;s soul-searching follows some shifts at b5media itself, which saw <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/02/big-blogger-pay-cuts-at-b5media/">massive pay cuts for bloggers</a> as the economy tumbled last fall.  It hasn&#8217;t been fun since then.</p>
<p>But at least the network as a whole is holding up, with comScore estimating 5.8 million worldwide unique visitors in May, 2009, up from 2.7 million last August. I had a brief chat with Wright, and he assured me revenues and traffic are holding steady, though he refused to detail either one.</p>
<p>CrunchBase tells us b5media has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/b5media">$2 million in venture funding</a> to date, but since he mentions &#8220;millions and millions of dollars&#8221; in his blog post I wanted to find out if it was actually more than that. Wright confirmed that the total amount of capital invested in the company is in fact higher than the listed $2 million, but refused to disclose any new investors, let alone any amounts.</p>
<p>Wright is moving on to new things, and in the meantime will run a consultancy agency of sorts along with some other people. The name of the short-term venture he will be shifting most of his attention to from now on is <a href="http://www.netmobs.com/">netmobs</a>.</p>

<p>It is not so much the apparent flat-out copying of TweetMeme&#8217;s Website design (ReTweet has not even launched in private beta yet), that bothers him. After all, TweetMeme itself was highly <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/17/if-execution-is-what-matters-where-does-that-leave-ideas/">&#8220;inspired&#8221;</a> by another news aggregator, <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a>.  What bugs him is what he claims to be almost exact copying of code.  Halstead writes on the <a href="http://blog.tweetmeme.com/2009/07/27/retweet-flattery/">TweetMeme blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What caught my attention was that some industrious individual (<a href="http://twitter.com/travisketchum">@travisketchum</a>) had left a comment on the <a href="../2009/07/26/retweetcom-looks-to-be-a-tweetmeme-competitor-with-a-killer-domain-name/" target="_blank">TechCrunch article</a> that he had been doing some digging around on the website and had found a link to their development environment. What we found ourselves was that our retweet button Javascript and the Wordpress plugin code seemed to have been directly copied from ours.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> ReTweet (or at least its holding company Mesiab Labs) <a href="http://mesiablabs.com/blog/?p=983">responds</a>.</p>
<p><a href=" http://twitter.com/home/?status=RT+%40TechCrunch+Tweetmeme+Wants+To+Be+The+King+Of+Retweets+http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fn2mrf5"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/retweet-button.jpg" class="shot2"/></a></p>
<p>He had to look no further than the code for the retweet button itself. The code below is what he found, which he says is &#8220;an exact copy of our own retweet button code with the word &#8216;tweetmeme&#8217; replaced with &#8216;retweet&#8217;”.</p>
<blockquote><p>(function()<br />

<p>I just hope all of these startups realize that Twitter could just end up <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/twitter-to-developers-tweet-your-heart-out-but-dont-twitter-it/">trademarking the term</a> just like they did with Tweet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>, one of the oldest social networks, is actively looking for a buyer and has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to find a party interested in acquiring the company or at least some of its assets.</p>
<p>According to documents obtained exclusively by TechCrunch, it looks like Morgan Stanley is shopping Friendster around in Asia, which makes sense considering <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/20/friendster-asias-social-network/">almost its entire user base</a> is located in the Asian-Pacific region. In the main document (embedded below), it says that 75 percent of its registered accounts are in Asia.  The docs come from a credible source, are time-stamped &#8216;July 2009&#8242; and carry a number of interesting nuggets about the influence Friendster still has in the social networking sphere, even if mostly in Asia.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/friendster-charts.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the summary fact sheet being sent to multiple potentially interested buyers, Friendster claims over 100 million registered users globally and touts its stronghold in the Asian-Pacific region as well as a bright future ahead since a number of its key markets (Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, aka SIMP) are expected to experience robust Internet user growth over the next few years. The fact sheet also says Friendster attracts over 100,000 new users and 500 million page views on a daily basis, making it a top 20 global website based on user traffic. According to the documents, the company currently has an employee headcount of 105 employees spread out across its global network of offices (Australia, the United States, Philippines and Singapore).</p>
<p>The fact sheet that we obtained shows that Friendster/Morgan Stanley are gunning for a buyer who wants to gain quick access to the Asian social networking scene, emphasizing it would be hard for newcomers to establish themselves given the relationships with local vendors and partners that are needed for such a venture to become a success. Additionally, it touts Friendster&#8217;s portfolio of <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2008/12/social-networki/">patents</a> in the space (5 granted and 10 pending) and its experienced management team.</p>
<p>More interesting nuggets of information: Friendster is looking to expand its current revenue streams to include—besides online advertising—virtual goods, gaming, surveys, dating, music and classifieds.</p>
<p>One thing we couldn&#8217;t gather from the documents, which are embedded below, is the price Friendster is hoping to get. The company is backed by more $45 million in capital venture firms like Battery Ventures, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, along with some early angel investors such as LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and Spinner/Grouper founder Josh Felcher.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/the-true-value-of-social-networks-the-2009-updated-model/">latest model valuing social networks</a> puts Friendster at only $210 million, based on Facebook&#8217;s recent valuation of $10 billion.  Mostly that is because of the lower spending power of consumers in Southeast Asia, making advertisers value them less differently.  That $10 billion Facebook valuation, though, was for preferred shares.  If you look at the $6.5B valuation of the most recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/dst-to-buy-up-to-100-million-in-facebook-employee-stock/">sale of common stock</a>, Friendster would be worth only $137M in comparison.  Back in 2002, the company turned down a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html?_r=2">$30 million buyout offer</a> from a pre-IPO Google.  (In an interesting twist, Friendster&#8217;s current CEO, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/richard-kimber">Richard Kimber</a>, used to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/04/friendster-grabs-a-google-exec-as-ceo/">head up sales for Google in South East Asia</a>).</p>
<p>We also took a look at the comScore numbers for Friendster in May, 2009 compared to the same period last year, and worldwide unique visitors dropped 45 percent to 21 million (suggesting there is a big difference between active and registered users).</p>
<p>With stats like these, no wonder the company and its investors are looking for a way to cash out.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/friendster-comscore-chart.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Also amusing was that a <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=friendster">quick search on Twitter</a> turned up mostly messages from US-based users that were deleting their Friendster accounts.</p>

<a href="http://www.scoutlabs.com/">Scout Labs,</a> a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/18/scout-labs-brand-tracker-now-generally-available/">SaaS dashboard</a> that makes it easy to keep track of what people across the internet are saying about particular topics or brands, has added a new focus group-like feature that is worth a look. 

The product, which we first reviewed in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/11/track-blog-reactions-to-your-brands-with-scout-labs/">December 2007</a> while still in private beta, now includes a "Quotes" section which pulls in real-time quotes from people who are chattering or Tweeting about a brand or topic on the web. The feature scans the quote for sentiment, and breaks quotes down by positive, negative or neutral undertones. The algorithm that deciphers the quotes also categorizes them as "wishes," "recommend," "issues," or "caveats." Caveats indicates comments that include the word "but." For example, a caveat quote would be "I like Netflix but..." And you can filter quotes from Twitter exclusively.

<p><a href="http://www.scoutlabs.com/">Scout Labs,</a> a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/18/scout-labs-brand-tracker-now-generally-available/">SaaS dashboard</a> that makes it easy to keep track of what people across the internet are saying about particular topics or brands, has added a new focus group-like feature that is worth a look. </p>
<p>The product, which we first reviewed in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/11/track-blog-reactions-to-your-brands-with-scout-labs/">December 2007</a> while still in private beta, now includes a &#8220;Quotes&#8221; section which pulls in real-time quotes from people who are chattering or Tweeting about a brand or topic on the web. The feature scans the quote for sentiment, and breaks quotes down by positive, negative or neutral undertones. The algorithm that deciphers the quotes also categorizes them as &#8220;wishes,&#8221; &#8220;recommend,&#8221; &#8220;issues,&#8221; or &#8220;caveats.&#8221; Caveats indicates comments that include the word &#8220;but.&#8221; For example, a caveat quote would be &#8220;I like Netflix but&#8230;&#8221; And you can filter quotes from Twitter exclusively.</p>
<p>There are six main sections to the Scout Labs dashboard: Blogs, Sentiment, Graphs, Photos, Videos, and Twitter. Blogs displays all of the blog posts that have been indexed by Scout Labs related to a particular keyword or phrase. The Sentiment section breaks these blog posts down into positive, neutral and negative categories. Graphs provides visual analytics of the sentiment around a brand on the web. And photos, videos and tweets related to your brand are collected for display as well. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that there is a need for companies to accurately and measure the real-time buzz around their brands on the web. Scout Labs seems to be a innovative tool to do this, and is reasonably priced. The dashboard costs $99 per month for tracking up to five brands. In its short lifespan, Scout Labs has been able to serve many big-name companies, including Coca-Cola, JetBlue, Netflix, McDonalds and Disney. Competitors in the space include ViralHeat and Radian6. </p>

The popular message board, famous for being able to brew online (and offline) shitstorms like no other web property could, saw portions of its publication - including /r9k/ and the infamous /b/ - blocked for AT&#038;T customers across the United States. Quickly enough, there was a lot of rallying going on, with 4chan members and fans <a href="http://s6.invisionfree.com/ProjectATT/index.php">virtually</a> <a href="http://encyclopediadramatica.com/AT%26T_Blocks_4chan">gathering</a> to plot digital riots and all-round mayhem.

An update on the situation as of 8 AM Eastern Time: access to 4chan has apparently been restored, with AT&#038;T reportedly confirming the hours-long block of portions of the site, “following the practices of their policy department.” AT&#038;T went on to say that they contacted (or at least <em>attempted</em> to contact) the owners of 4chan, which Moot <a href="http://status.4chan.org/"><del datetime="2009-07-27T12:15:19+00:00">vehemently</del> denies</a>.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/att-deathstar.jpg" class="shot2" />AT&#038;T has made even more people than usual angry when it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/att-blocks-4chan-this-is-going-to-get-ugly/">started blocking/filtering parts of 4chan</a> late last night. The popular message board, famous for being able to brew online (and offline) shitstorms like no other web property could, saw portions of its publication - including /r9k/ and the infamous /b/ - blocked for AT&#038;T customers across the United States. Quickly enough, there was a lot of rallying going on, with 4chan members and fans <a href="http://s6.invisionfree.com/ProjectATT/index.php">virtually</a> <a href="http://encyclopediadramatica.com/AT%26T_Blocks_4chan">gathering</a> to plot digital riots and all-round mayhem.</p>
<p>An update on the situation as of 8 AM Eastern Time: access to 4chan has apparently been restored, with AT&#038;T reportedly confirming the hours-long block of portions of the site, “following the practices of their policy department.” (see updates below)</p>
<p>AT&#038;T went on to say that they contacted (or at least <em>attempted</em> to contact) the owners of 4chan, which Moot <a href="http://status.4chan.org/"><del datetime="2009-07-27T12:15:19+00:00">vehemently</del> denies</a>. AT&#038;T told <a href="http://www.centralgadget.com/att-blocking-access-to-portions-of-4chan-2336/">CentralGadget</a> that they have specific reasons why they blocked these parts of the site, but they would not disclose them, further stating that they have requested specific things and changes from 4chan’s owners to which they have failed to comply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 4chan is apparently under DDoS attack, supposedly because of the attention the site has been getting for the past 12 hours. The site is sometimes down, sometimes up but very slow, according to various reports. Note that this is not AT&#038;T&#8217;s responsibility and quite possibly even the reason for the company to have made the dangerous decision of restricting access to the message board in the first place.</p>
<p>Updates coming, including some of the actions taken by 4chan members and friends to retaliate.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/AT_T_CEO_Dead_outside_his_home_iReport_com?OTC-kff">this thread on Digg</a> (760 votes and counting) pointed to a now-removed fake article at CNN&#8217;s iReport about the death of AT&#038;T CEO Randall Stephenson.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thepoint.com/campaigns/boycott-at-t-internet-services">pledge up at ThePoint</a> to boycott AT&#038;T and cancel the Internet service with them.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xribI5BZSVU">YouTube alert</a></p>
<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> an announcement on the <a href="http://z6.invisionfree.com/ProjectATT/">Project AT&#038;T forum</a> reads: &#8220;All rioting/&#8217;war&#8217;/protests have been suspended for the time being.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update 5:</strong> AT&#038;T got back to us with a statement</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning Friday, an AT&#038;T customer was impacted by a denial-of-service attack stemming from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org.  To prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&#038;T customer, and to prevent the attack from spreading to impact our other customers, AT&#038;T temporarily blocked access to the IP addresses in question for our customers.  This action was in no way related to the content at img.4chan.org; our focus was on protecting our customers from malicious traffic.  </p>
<p>Overnight Sunday, after we determined the denial-of-service threat no longer existed, AT&#038;T removed the block on the IP addresses in question. We will continue to monitor for denial-of-service activity and any malicious traffic to protect our customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 6:</strong> 4chan owner Moot has updated the <a href="http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2174049422947602936">status blog</a> with a bit of an explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>For the past three weeks, 4chan has been under a constant DDoS attack. We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that was more or less transparent to the end user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as an unintended consequence of the method used, some Internet users received errant traffic from one of our network switches. A handful happened to be AT&#038;T customers.</p>
<p>In response, AT&#038;T filtered all traffic to and from our img.4chan.org IPs (which serve /b/ &#038; /r9k/) for their entire network, instead of only the affected customers. AT&#038;T did not contact us prior to implementing the block. Here is their statement regarding the matter.</p>
<p>In the end, this wasn&#8217;t a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&#038;T&#8217;s part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn&#8217;t anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and internet censorship—two very important issues that don&#8217;t get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&#8217;ll also add that there is some big news due later this week. Keep an eye on the News page, Twitter, and global message for updates.</p>
<p>As always, I can be reached at moot@4chan.org.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>PS: If any companies would like to hook us up with some better hardware, feel free! The architecture we&#8217;ve got powering this large and influential beast is really quite embarrassing. ( ._.)</p></blockquote>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-86855" title="439039873_e8ff5f0e41" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/439039873_e8ff5f0e41.jpg" alt="439039873_e8ff5f0e41" width="287" height="350" />An interesting report <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28129982-7a18-11de-b86f-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1">hit the Financial Times</a> today, indicating that Apple is working with all of the major music labels on a way to boost album sales. But the report is confusing in a number of regards, and is propelling <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090726/p14#a090726p14">new rumors</a> that Apple&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/large-form-ipod-touch-to-launch-in-fall-09/">large form iPod touch</a>, or tablet (which itself is naturally still a rumor, though an increasingly likely one), could be rushed to be out in time for the holidays — this year.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a step back for a second here. FT seems to go back and forth between tying this new Apple/music label effort, which is apparently code-named &#8220;Cocktail&#8221;, with this new device. At first, it indicates that it&#8217;s separate (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The talks come as <strong>Apple is separately racing to offer a portable, full-featured, tablet-sized computer</strong> <strong>in time for the Christmas </strong>shopping season, in what the entertainment industry hopes will be a new revolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it goes on to say (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The device could be launched alongside the new content deals</strong>, including those aimed at stimulating sales of CD-length music, according to people briefed on the project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, except that it then goes on to say (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The labels and Apple are working towards <strong>a September launch date for the project</strong>, which aims to boost interest in albums by bundling liner notes and video clips with the music.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the Financial Times seems to be both suggesting that Apple&#8217;s tablet is closely tied to this new Cocktail project, which could launch in September. Or, the tablet is a separate project and will launch in time for the holiday shopping season (typically late November). Of course, reports last week had Apple working hard just to get <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/report-the-large-form-ipod-touch-apples-tablet-on-track-for-early-2010/">the tablet device done for Q1 2010</a>. So what gives?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it sounds like is happening. The music industry people that FT talked to are excited about the prospects of their new project with Apple, but they&#8217;re even more excited about this new tablet device. As I&#8217;m reading it, project Cocktail sounds pretty ho-hum by itself (um, liner notes as an incentive, again, really?), but this is the key part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers would be able to play songs directly from the interactive book without clicking back into Apple’s iTunes software, executives said.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-86857" title="picture-1210" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1210.png" alt="picture-1210" width="328" height="314" />So it sounds like project Cocktail could offer special functionality that may be optimized for this tablet (and perhaps the iPhone and iPod touch). And so that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re probably talking up the new device, which they may or may not have even seen, as is indicated by the FT report still not knowing the actual screen size.</p>
<p>All of this is also interesting because it&#8217;s Apple apparently working closely with the record labels — two sides which have had plenty of disagreements in the past. And this seems to be all about album sales, something which you could easily argue that iTunes is responsible for hurting with its per-track structure.</p>
<p>But the labels just recently got their way and forced Apple to up the price of many songs on iTunes. At the same time, album prices largely stayed the same (though some went up). So now it appears that the labels also want to make more off of albums, by not only giving users a reason to buy them, but I would imagine also charging more for these special Cocktail albums.</p>
<p>But will it work? From the way this story reads, it seems like it may be contingent on this new Apple device. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I could care less about liner notes that the albums on iTunes already have. If anything, I&#8217;d prefer <em>not</em> to get them, as they just clutter up my music library. And iTunes already has plenty of &#8220;special&#8221; versions of albums that have bonus music videos and other goodies. So unless this story is about nothing, it would seem that FT just isn&#8217;t describing Cocktail very well for the most part, and instead we should look to the description of it as a highly interactive experience for music.</p>
<p>But then the report jumps back to being about the tablet — and it reads like the device will matter more for movies, than music:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entertainment industry is hoping that Apple, which revolutionised the markets for music players and phones, can do it again with the new device.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be fabulous for watching movies,” said one entertainment executive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe books:</p>
<blockquote><p>Book publishers have been in talks with Apple and are optimistic about their services being offered with the new computer, which could provide an alternative to Amazon’s Kindle.</p></blockquote>
<p>In all likelihood, Apple is probably targeting all three (music, movies and books) with the new device, but it&#8217;s hard to follow here.</p>
<p>Most importantly, how likely is it that we&#8217;re going to see such a device in just a couple of months? Probably not too likely.</p>

We think it&#8217;s because more flexibility is needed that no single product can meet, but an open platform can.&#8221;</em> That&#8217;s what <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.tv</a> VP of Marketing Evan Solomon tells us in announcing the opening up of the service&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>The API, which has been in closed testing for about a month now, will now be available to anyone who wishes to use it, <em>for free</em>. Justin.tv can do this because they&#8217;ve made live video cheap to serve. Their internal network has capacity for some 100 million hours of video viewing per month, we&#8217;re told. For some perspective, that&#8217;s roughly 2.5% of media giant Comcast&#8217;s capacity, but Justin.tv is run at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s totally free with no strings attached. The initial launch of the API will be supported by ads. And eventually, a payment platform will be built-in to the API as well for developers who wish to service live video ad-free. In those cases, there would be revenue sharing with Justin.tv, we&#8217;re told. Still, the ad-supported free model makes it very compelling next to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/stickams-streamapi-makes-doing-it-live-easy-and-cheap/">Stickam&#8217;s StreamAPI</a> and Ustream&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/17/ustreamtv-launches-watershed-a-pay-as-you-go-live-streaming-service-for-enterprises/">offerings</a>, both of which charge per view hour.</p>
<p>But costs aside, the key here is the access to the live video. Justin.tv is just one company and needs to maintain its core product, which means side projects like <a href="http://camtweet.com/">Camtweet</a>, which was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/10/camtweet-does-justintv-live-on-twitter/">unveiled at our Real-time Stream event</a> earlier this month and was built using this new API, aren&#8217;t going to pop up everyday. But with developers given access to the same tools, now Justin.tv doesn&#8217;t need to worry about doing all the work, it can have the community help is making cool new live video applications.</p>
<p>And just to give developers so ideas of what they can do with this API, Justin.tv internally made a few simple live video apps besides Camtweet. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group chat application that allows an arbitrary number of broadcasts to be displayed on a single page as people join</li>
<li>A <span>Mac</span> <span>OSX</span> <span>dashboard</span> widget that plays live video, allows search and includes a chat room&#8211;you can download this here, but please don&#8217;t share the URL <a href="http://soda.berkeley.edu/%7Ekfb/jtv_dashboard.zip" target="_blank">http://soda.berkeley.edu/~kfb/jtv_dashboard.zip</a></li>
<li>An automated event widget that can be embedded anywhere&#8211;once you setup an event the widget shows a countdown timer, automatically switches to a live video broadcast and then creates and displays a highlight clip after the event ends</li>
<li>A baby monitor that alerts you when something happens in the broadcast&#8211;you can try this one out here <a href="http://www.slumbervision.com/" target="_blank">http://www.slumbervision.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get access to these, dig into them, and get documentation on Justin.tv&#8217;s API wiki found <a href="http://apiwiki.justin.tv/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">here</a>. You can also find the source code for Camtweet, which has been open-sourced, on Github <a href="http://github.com/justintv/jtv_camtweet/tree/master">here</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect we may see the other live video services follow suit with free, ad-supported APIs.

Sandwiched neatly between the RealTime is God and RealTime Who Needs It crowds is a new group that embraces both positions while moving forward rapidly. These folks include Brett Slatkin of the PubSubHubub effort and Dave Winer of rssCloud.org. Slatkin and fellow conspirator Brad Fitzpatrick demoed the PSHBB architecture at the RealTime Stream Crunchup, and Winer quickly jumped in with his own implementation.

While Winer attacked PSHBB as a Google (and TechCrunch) conspiracy, the rhetoric seemed mostly in service of his own plans for a decentralized open platform not controlled by bigcos. The charges don't make sense — PSHBB is not a Google effort but rather one started by Fitzpatrick and Slatkin on their own — and like Winer's, proposed and delivered as an open architecture that can be spread across multiple players. In other words, they're saying the same thing.

Digging deeper, it could be that Winer's concern is that adoption by Google or other platform players will create a bandwagon effect that could lock out smaller independent developers. There's certainly some truth to that dynamic, as PSHBB is already running in a number of cooperating platform implementations including FeedBurner, WordPress, and even FriendFeed, where Slatkin is active in tracking user issues. But ironically, by offering a competing framework, Winer  takes away the argument of unfairness. If developers and publishers want to adopt one platform over another because it's got more mainstream adoption, they're free to do so. In the past, Winer has been the beneficiary of just such choices, with RSS 2.0 proliferating in no small part due to support from Microsoft on the platform side and the New York Times on the publishing side.]]></description>

<p>4chan has been called many things, most of which aren&#8217;t particularly flattering.  Some parts of the site are almost entirely unmoderated, leading to a wild-west, highly NSFW environment where irreverance, mischief, and lewdness thrive (I like to think of it as the Mos Eisley of the web).  But that doesn&#8217;t mean the site isn&#8217;t <i>extremely</i> influential on web culture.  Many of its exploits are famous, including <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/21/4chan-takes-over-the-time-100/">taking over</a> the Time 100 list, and it&#8217;s also where some of the Internet&#8217;s most famous memes got their start, including the Rick Roll and LOLcats.  It&#8217;s also known as the main hub for Anonymous, a group that has held a very public campaign against Scientology.</p>
<p>In other words, AT&#038;T has just opened perhaps the most vindictive, messy can of worms it could have possibly found.  Blocking <i>any</i> site is an extreme breach of user trust, but the decision to block 4chan in particular just seems stupid. Expect the web equivalent of rioting if this doesn&#8217;t change soon.

That comes despite the fact that Ning traffic appears to be flatlining, and revenue to date is likely very small.

A typical comment to that post: <em>"What an ASTOUNDING way to waste money."</em> Others pointed out that venture capitalists typically invest hoping to at least have a chance at a 10x return - and in Ning's case, it seems unlikely that the company will be worth the necessary $7.5 billion any time soon. So, why'd they invest?

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/lightspeed.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot" alt="" />A lot of readers were incredulous over <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/as-nings-us-audience-flattens-it-raises-another-15-million/">last week&#8217;s news</a> that <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> raised another $15 million in venture capital from <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/lightspeed-venture-partners">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a> at a $750 million valuation. That comes despite the fact that Ning traffic appears to be flatlining, and revenue to date is likely very small.</p>
<p>A typical comment to that post: <em>&#8220;What an ASTOUNDING way to waste money.&#8221;</em> Others pointed out that venture capitalists typically invest hoping to at least have a chance at a 10x return - and in Ning&#8217;s case, it seems unlikely that the company will be worth the necessary $7.5 billion any time soon. So, why&#8217;d they invest?</p>
<p>Marketing.</p>
<p>Lightspeed doesn&#8217;t have an investment in a big name social networking startup right now. In fact, their entire Internet <a href="http://www.lightspeedvp.com/Portfolio/Default.aspx?cat=Internet">portfolio</a> looks a little sleepy and dated. Competitors like <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock">Greylock</a> can show investments in Facebook and LinkedIn, two of the hottest pre-IPO startups in Silicon Valley (as well as Pandora and SGN, both of which are getting lots of press attention and fast user growth). </p>
<p>Lightspeed needs to get itself back in the game. And Ning was willing to take the money. A match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Do they expect to see a big return on the investment? Almost certainly not. But they also haven&#8217;t put their money at extreme risk. They likely have a liquidation preference that lets them get their $15 million out of the company before others can take part of the pie. So effectively they just bougtht themselves a bunch of marketing with their limited partners&#8217; money.</p>
<p>Of course, the LPs don&#8217;t really mind, since they look at returns on the fund, not individual investments. And it may work out well for them. When Greylock invested $25 million in Facebook in 2006 at then-absurd valuation many of the same criticisms were leveled at them, too. But they had a stake in the hottest startup around at the time, and increased their profile in Silicon Valley. Likewise, Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/">investment in Facebook at a $15 billion</a> valuation, was done not in the hope of making money on the investment, but to lock up a search marketing deal.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day Ning gets some much needed additional capital in exchange for a tiny amount of equity, and Lightspeed gets its name associated with the Ning and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> brands. And while they won&#8217;t expect to make much of a return on that investment, they will almost certainly get that money back, at least. Everybody wins.</p>

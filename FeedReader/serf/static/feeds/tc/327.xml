For all the <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090810/h0845">angst</a> around the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">demise of Tr.im</a>, the fact is that there are way too many URL shortening services in the world and inevitably more will fall by the wayside.  There simply is no need for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/analysis-which-url-shortening-service-should-you-use-17204">more than a dozen services</a> to make long URLs shorter (and that doesn't even count services such as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/supr-stumbles-out-of-beta-officially-enters-url-shortening-wars/">Su.pr</a> or the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/diggbar-changes-permanent-no-longer-a-short-url-service/">Diggbar</a> which incorporate a URL shortener as a feature).

Already, the market is consolidating around bit.ly, largely thanks to it being the official URL shortener adopted by Twitter (which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">switched</a> from competitor TinyURL back in May).  Currently, <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> makes up 79.6 percent of the short URLs on Twitter, according to <a href=" http://tweetmeme.com/about/statistics">stats</a> kept by Tweetmeme. It is followed by <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL </a>(with 13.75 percent), <a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> (2.47 percent), <a href="http://ow.ly/url/shorten-url">ow.ly</a> (2.26 percent), and FriendFeed's ff.im (1.92 percent). ]]></description>

<p>For all the <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090810/h0845">angst</a> around the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">demise of Tr.im</a>, the fact is that there are way too many URL shortening services in the world and inevitably more will fall by the wayside.  There simply is no need for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/analysis-which-url-shortening-service-should-you-use-17204">more than a dozen services</a> to make long URLs shorter (and that doesn&#8217;t even count services such as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/supr-stumbles-out-of-beta-officially-enters-url-shortening-wars/">Su.pr</a> or the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/diggbar-changes-permanent-no-longer-a-short-url-service/">Diggbar</a> which incorporate a URL shortener as a feature).</p>
<p>Already, the market is consolidating around bit.ly, largely thanks to it being the official URL shortener adopted by Twitter (which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">switched</a> from competitor TinyURL back in May).  Currently, <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> makes up 79.6 percent of the short URLs on Twitter, according to <a href=" http://tweetmeme.com/about/statistics">stats</a> kept by Tweetmeme. It is followed by <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL </a>(with 13.75 percent), <a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> (2.47 percent), <a href="http://ow.ly/url/shorten-url">ow.ly</a> (2.26 percent), and FriendFeed&#8217;s ff.im (1.92 percent). </p>
<p>On Friday, before it shut down, Tr.im was no. 4 on the list, even with ow.ly.  So when I say that Tr.im is not going to be missed I do not mean that it was not loved by some users. It was even moderately popular.  But as you can see from the market shares above, it is hard to compete against bit.ly since it is Twitter&#8217;s default URL shortener.  Twitter should just buy it already and put all the other ones out of their misery.  Until it does that, it is in Twitter&#8217;s interest to keep a few alternatives in the wings. If it ever chose to switch to another default service, that one would grow to 70 to 80 percent of all short links within a few months as well.  </p>
<p>In other words, if bit.ly ever slips on the innovation front, it can easily be replaced.  But bit.ly is more than a URL shortening service. All of those links hold valuable data.  Collecting that data plays into its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/bitlys-grand-plans-and-their-inevitable-clash-with-digg-bitly-now/">grander plans</a> to show users deep analytics and the most popular links being shared at any given time.  Tr.im didn&#8217;t have any such plans.  It was an afterthought of <a href="http://nambu.com/">Nambu</a>, whose main focus is to make a killer stream reader.  If making URLs short (and mining the resulting data) is not your main business, it is hard to compete against startups who do nothing else.</p>
<p>Many developers and others find <a href=" http://scobleizer.com/2009/08/10/twitters-platform-shortcomings/">Twitter&#8217;s favoritism maddening</a>, but that is how standards are created (right or wrong).  As for Tr.im users who are afraid they will lose their data or that all of their short links will be broken, bit.ly has offered to create a short-link redirecting archive at <a href="http://www.301works.com/">301works</a>.  Nambu should take them up on the offer.</p>
<p>What happens to those links is really what we should be worried about.  Broken links mess up the Web.  All URL shortening services should make a directory of all of their short links available where anyone (especially search engines) can look up the underlying long link where each one redirects. Maybe this is 301works or some other non-profit repository, but having all of these non-standard short links proliferate will just create more problems down the road when other URL shorteners inevitably fail.  And fail they will, which is another reason for publishers to use their own custom URL shortener (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/its-awesm-create-a-powerful-custom-url-shortener-for-your-own-domain/">we use Awe.sm</a>) and always control their data.</p>

The service provides high quality "strategically correct" branding for startups for about the same price as domain registration, effectively bypassing what is a traditionally expensive and time-consuming process with 'brand expert' agencies.

Answer a few questions about your business and buildabrand will provide a selection of brand identities: logos, fonts and so on. You can then apply that branding (after customizing it, if you choose) to downloadable graphics, stationery, website templates and even - eventually - merchandise like pens and, er, beach towels. You just pay for the items you order or download. The service requires no creative skills from users.]]></description>

<p>Answer a few questions about your business and buildabrand will provide a selection of brand identities: logos, fonts and so on. You can then apply that branding (after customizing it, if you choose) to downloadable graphics, stationery, website templates and even - eventually - merchandise like pens and, er, beach towels. You just pay for the items you order or download. The service requires no creative skills from users.

<p>More than two years after buying advertising network <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-pays-6-billion-for-aquantive/">aQuantive for $6 billion</a>, Microsoft finally unloaded the digital advertising agency that came with that deal.  It sold <a href="http://www.razorfish.com/">Razorfish</a> to French advertising conglomerate Publicis Groupe for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=agZekSvwGGf8">$530 million</a> in a combination stock-and-cash transaction.  The price was 1.4 times Razorfish&#8217;s 2008 sales of $380 million.  </p>
<p>Microsoft has been <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090628/p10#a090628p10">shopping Razorfish around</a> all summer.  It was reportedly hoping to get $600 to $700 million, but the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">advertising recession</a> didn&#8217;t help.  Microsoft settled for a slight discount to that.  </p>
<p>But at least now Microsoft is out of the people-heavy ad agency business (Razorfish has 2,000 employees), and can concentrate more on its automated search and display ad platforms.  Razorfish remains one of Microsoft&#8217;s preferred ad agencies (it came up with the Bing ads).  And as part of the deal, Publicis agreed to purchase both search and display ads from Microsoft on behalf of its clients.  </p>
<p>Maybe that is where Microsoft will make up the difference between the $530 million and its original asking price.</p>

We are trying to verify the information and gather more details on the hardware and operating system now.</p>
<p>Our sources on new hardware coming out of Asia tend to be spot on (we broke the news of the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/07/15/kindle-20-coming-around-october-2008/">second and third generation Amazon Kindles</a>, the launch of the <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/01/04/exclusive-new-palm-phone-to-have-slide-down-keyboard-large-touchscreen/">Palm Pre</a> and the existence of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/29/forget-the-palm-pre-theyve-got-a-second-device-coming-out-this-year-were-calling-it-the-mini-pre/">second Palm WebOS phone</a> and generally have good information on sales figures for iPhones, Kindles and other devices). But in this case the information we&#8217;ve received is extremely thin.</p>
<p>There have been reports of Dell launching a phone in the Chinese market in recent months, with rumors of the carrier partner being China Mobile in <a href="http://www.jlmpacificepoch.com/newsstories?id=145645_0_5_0_M">one case</a> and China Unicom in <a href="China Unicom">another</a>.</p>
<p>There is also wide speculation on the operating system, but we&#8217;re guessing it&#8217;s Android. Dell has also been working with Google on an Android-powered tablet computer in recent months. But in April Reuters had a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSTP9541020090414?pageNumber=1&#038;virtualBrandChannel=0">report</a> that Dell may be creating a proprietary operating system with China-based software maker Red Office.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve heard on the hardware: iPhone-like, touchscreen, no physical keyboard. that&#8217;s it for now. Keep an eye on the Dell China <a href="http://www.dell.com.cn/">site</a>.</p>

According to a <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/159369789/tr-im-r-i-p">blog post</a>, the reason behind the decision is Twitter&#8217;s decision to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/url-shortening-wars-twitter-ditches-tinyurl-for-bitly/">use bit.ly</a> for their URL shortening, as well as the cost for servers and development while there are many other solutions for URL shortening.</p>
<p>Nambu Networks will now focus its attention on Nambu for Mac OS and iPhone.</p>
<blockquote><p>tr.im did well for what it was, but, alas, it was not enough. We simply cannot find a way to justify continuing to work on it, or pay its network costs, which are not inconsequential. tr.im pushes (as I write this) a lot of redirects and URL creations per day, and this required significant development investment and server expansion to accommodate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nambu Network&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t specifically say how many URL&#8217;s have been shortened, but looking at Twitter, tr.im was quite popular. The URL&#8217;s already shortened with tr.im will not be affected, but all tr.im links will continue to redirect, and will do so until at least December 31, 2009.</p>
<p>tr.im has been added to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool/">Deadpool</a>.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/familyties.png" class="shot2"/>Since I joined TechCrunch I&#8217;ve seen more Twitter clones and derivatives then I&#8217;d care to remember, most of which haven&#8217;t really gone anywhere.  But there are a few gems that have managed to tackle markets that Twitter has, for whatever reason, ignored.  One of these is <a href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a>, the &#8220;Twitter for businesses&#8221; that won the top prize at last year&#8217;s TechCrunch50.  And in the last few days, it&#8217;s become increasingly clear to me that there&#8217;s another niche market just waiting for a Twitter-like service: Family.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I was talking to TechCrunch alum (and rockstar dev) <a href="http://henrywork.com/">Henry Work</a>, who told me he was thinking of setting up a Yammer account with the sole purpose of keeping in touch with his immediate family.  It&#8217;s a fantastic idea — Yammer allows for secure, private communication, offers an iPhone app, SMS support, and a web client, and is free for basic functionality.  Even better: the company has just comfirmed that it&#8217;s planning to offer Push notifications for its iPhone app in the near future, which would help cut back on SMS costs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to think of countless ways that a family-oriented Yammer group could come in handy, especially for families with children who are still in school.   Need someone to pick up the kids from baseball practice?  Send out a message and see if a spouse or older sibling can help, without having to wade through a game of phone tag.  Quickly send out reminders that you&#8217;re heading to Grandma&#8217;s house in the morning to make sure nobody sleeps in. And, of course, you can hold nightly polls to figure out what&#8217;s for dinner.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one hitch.  Yammer only accepts users with company Email addresses — you can&#8217;t just fill in your Gmail account and get started.  Anyone looking to use Yammer in this fashion would have to register their own domain name and create a new Email account for each family member.  In other words, it&#8217;s not something that the vast majority of the population is going to be doing any time soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are a handful of under-appreciated startups that have had this very idea, but a quick Google search for &#8220;Twitter for families&#8221; doesn&#8217;t reveal any obvious choices.  In fact, most of the relevant links are articles talking about people who actually <i>do </i> use Twitter itself to talk to their families.  I suppose that would work if you kept all of your tweets private and didn&#8217;t want to let anyone other than your family members follow you, but that doesn&#8217;t seem practical.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what we need:  a Yammer-like service that allows for easy signups (rather than use domains to restrict registrations, it could simply require approval from the family&#8217;s account admin).   Monetization could involve premium features (calendar reminders?) or perhaps a low monthly fee.  Given that it already has the technology, Yammer could obviously build something like this fairly quickly — they could even use it to further extend the <a href="http://www.geni.com">Geni</a> brand (Yammer was a Geni spin-off).  And if they don&#8217;t do it, someone else should.</p>

There is no shortage of controversy surrounding the company right now thanks largely to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/the-state-of-the-iphone-is-strong-very-strong/">hugely popular</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/how-i-learned-to-quit-the-iphone-and-love-google-voice/">hugely unpopular</a> aspects of the iPhone. But Jason Calacanis' post yesterday entitled "<a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/">The Case Against Apple-in Five Parts</a>" serves as a great springboard for bringing up a lot of it.

<strong>The Backstory</strong>

While my story with computers doesn't go back quite as far as Calacanis', our stories are pretty similar. He said that 6 years ago he made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year affair with Microsoft. I made the same switch 5 years ago after a roughly 15-year affair with Microsoft.

Regular readers may have heard this already, so forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but in the 1990s I loved Microsoft products and hated Apple stuff. I grew up on DOS, installed Windows For Workgroups because I thought it was cooler than regular Windows 3.1, bought Windows Bob, made my dad take me to the midnight launch of Windows 95, bought Windows 98 the day it came out, actually bought and used Windows ME, and bought Windows XP the day it came out. I could fill that timeline in with many other pro-Microsoft details, but let's just say I was hooked.]]></description>

But Jason Calacanis&#8217; post yesterday entitled &#8220;<a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/">The Case Against Apple-in Five Parts</a>&#8221; serves as a great springboard for bringing up a lot of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Backstory</strong></p>
<p>While my story with computers doesn&#8217;t go back quite as far as Calacanis&#8217;, our stories are pretty similar. He said that 6 years ago he made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year affair with Microsoft. I made the same switch 5 years ago after a roughly 15-year affair with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regular readers may have heard this already, so forgive me if I&#8217;m repeating myself, but in the 1990s I loved Microsoft products and hated Apple stuff. I grew up on DOS, installed Windows For Workgroups because I thought it was cooler than regular Windows 3.1, bought Windows Bob, made my dad take me to the midnight launch of Windows 95, bought Windows 98 the day it came out, actually bought and used Windows ME, and bought Windows XP the day it came out. I could fill that timeline in with many other pro-Microsoft details, but let&#8217;s just say I was hooked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I loved Microsoft because I didn&#8217;t know anything else. Our high school was Mac-only. I hated it. The systems were slow, I hated their UI and I just found them generally frustrating to work with. And I used them everyday for years. Throughout all of high school and college I only bought PCs even after many viruses and a few complete system failures.</p>
<p>So what changed? For me, two things. First, the iPod. Second, OS X.</p>
<p>After I finished college in 2004, I bought my first iPod. Prior to that I had been using several other MP3 players (one of which I got for free when I bought Windows XP). But I needed a new device with a lot of storage for my long drive out to California. Obviously, I had heard great things about the iPod, and despite its high price tag, I decided to get one.</p>
<p>The fact that it was so much better than every other MP3 player I had used to that point said nothing specifically about Apple&#8217;s other products, but it did plant the thought in my head that if Apple was able to make such a nice experience for its portable music players, maybe its computer experience had also evolved from the poor one I remembered from high school. Still, I was a broke just-out-of-college kid, and Macs were yes, expensive. So my curiosity remained a curiosity for the time-being.</p>
<p>But a few months later, I was living in LA and working in Hollywood. Everyone there was using Macs, and as such, I had to use one at my job. Less than a week into using one on a regular basis, I realized something: I liked OS X a lot. Since it was released after my time in high school, and I still generally avoided Macs in college, I hadn&#8217;t really ever used the OS before. But in Hollywood, I was forced to, and I really liked it.</p>
<p>If the iPod had planted the Apple seed in my head, using OS X watered it. The conclusion soon blossomed: Apple now made great products.</p>
<p>Within a couple of months I had bought my own Mac (the cheapest white MacBook I could find) to serve as a back up to my PC. A couple months after that I basically stopped using my PC. A couple months after that I shipped the PC home as a present for my dad. I have never bought another PC since. During that time, I have bought 5 Macs.</p>
<p><strong>The Product</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90880" title="2586298923_17cb4ce40f" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2586298923_17cb4ce40f.jpg" alt="2586298923_17cb4ce40f" width="275" height="324" /></strong>Okay, that is a lot of set up to get to an opening point, and one that is actually the most important point. I made the switch from the PC world to the Mac world because of one thing: I believed that Apple started making better products than the other guys.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple point, one that is certainly subjective, but I really believed it, and that&#8217;s why I switched. And it&#8217;s why I remain an Apple-user despite some of the headaches, which I&#8217;ll get to. If you make a great product, you can get away with a lot — which again, Apple has. But it is my belief that it will continue to, because at the end of the day all that really matters is the product.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s despite Calacanis&#8217; belief that there&#8217;s a brewing backlash against Apple. Sure, there is a small one among tech journalists and some in the mobile <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/fed-up-a-popular-mac-developer-quits-the-iphone/">developer community</a>. And I do believe it is warranted. But the fact remains that Apple&#8217;s business is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/22/economy-be-damned-apple-posts-its-best-second-quarter-earnings-ever/">stronger</a> than it has ever <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/apple-sold-twice-as-many-iphones-as-macs-last-quarter/">been</a>, and that&#8217;s because more people are Apple users — whether that be Mac computers, iPods or iPhones.</p>
<p>The easiest way to continue on at this point will be to look at and address each of Calacanis&#8217; 5 points.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices</strong></em></p>
<p>Calacanis argues that Apple should open iTunes to any MP3 players on the market. He says that if that occurred, other MP3 players not necessarily made by Apple would flourish. I think he has it backwards.</p>
<p>I actually think iTunes is <em>not</em> a great piece of software, and that Apple could do a much better job with it (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">iTunes 9 might help</a> out with that). And I believe Apple may actually know that, as I have heard whispers that they&#8217;ve been trying to completely revamp it for some time now, with no luck so far.</p>
<p>The key ingredient in the iTunes/iPod universe is the full ecosystem aspect of it. iTunes isn&#8217;t great for the straightforward managing of music, but it is brilliant for buying music through iTunes and having it sync automatically with your iPod (and now your iPhone).</p>
<p>Even if Apple opened iTunes up for use with other MP3 players, I have a hard time believing the market would flow towards other players. Having used quite a few of the MP3 players that are available in the U.S., I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that the iPod (all its different flavors) is still the best of breed. There may be better ones in Asian countries, but some of the features that Calacanis talks about like TV-tuners would not fly here. (This is something I&#8217;ll hit on again later when we get into the iPhone.)</p>
<p>But the key here is that with iTunes open to other MP3 players, Apple would have less control over the user experience, something which is very important to them. Adding non-Apple devices which Apple would have little or no control over from a hardware perspective would be a headache for them and in turn, for some users. It might be worth it if they made significant money from music sales on iTunes, but they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Sure, some people do not want or like that level of control, and there is somewhat of an argument that it is in some ways anti-competitive, but the majority of users of iPods benefit from the ease of use that a contained ecosystem provides.</p>
<p>And the bigger picture is that this really doesn&#8217;t matter that much anyway, because the iPod and all other MP3 players as we know them are currently in the process of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/the-ipod-as-we-know-it-is-dying/">a slow death</a>. And as devices connected to the web take over, eventually much of the media consumption and management on these devices will occur on the device itself.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90884" title="picture-34" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-34.png" alt="picture-34" width="299" height="266" />&#8220;<em>Apple’s iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking–wait for it–AT&amp;T’s monopoly in the ’70s and ’80s,</em>&#8221; Calacanis writes. On one hand that is a very interesting statement, in so much as it relates to AT&amp;T specifically. On the other, it&#8217;s pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree that Apple and AT&amp;T&#8217;s exclusive partnership is a problem. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/">It&#8217;s a big problem</a>. And I think for both consumers and Apple it needs to end when the deal is up next year. But I believe that Apple realizes that too, and will open the device to other networks (or at least announce the intention to do so) at some point next year. It simply makes no sense not to. Not only is AT&amp;T performing poorly under the strain of so many iPhones, but for Apple to keep expanding its user base, it simply needs to be on other carriers in the U.S.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s all-too-easy to forget that the iPhone has absolutely changed the mobile landscape in the U.S. for the better. We complain about not being able to browse the web on AT&amp;T&#8217;s crappy network, but think back not even 5 years ago when the idea of browsing the mobile web at all, was absurd.</p>
<p>I remember being very excited to get the Motorola RAZR when it finally came to Verizon. I still have that phone; it&#8217;s laughable compared to just about every phone on the market right now. And a lot of that is thanks to the iPhone. I&#8217;m not saying there would not have been innovation without it, but I am saying that Apple&#8217;s product made its competitors get their heads out of their asses, and we&#8217;re starting to see the fruits of that with nice devices from Palm, RIM and some of the newer Android phones. Ones that don&#8217;t have to use the shitty carrier-built operating systems.</p>
<p>Yes, it sucks that the iPhone is tied to AT&amp;T right now. But my CDMA RAZR was tied to Verizon, and I was stuck using their hideous operating system which offered me next to nothing. My point is just that in some ways, many of us have been spoiled this past 2+ years with the iPhone. It&#8217;s easy to forget what it was like before it existed. Which is to say, awful.</p>
<p>And just to hop back to the Asian marketplace, which I mentioned earlier, it is true that they have had some amazing phones with amazing capabilities for a while. But the point is that here in America, the carriers had us completely under siege with horrible phones and even worse plans until very recently. When Apple cut its deal with AT&amp;T for the iPhone, the same deal we all now bitch about (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">maybe none more than me</a>), it changed the landscape — for the better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into Calacanis&#8217; two SIM card idea, which sounds nice, but would be a complicated nightmare that hardly anyone would pay for.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Draconian App Store policies that are, frankly, insulting</strong></em></p>
<p>I agree with a lot of this, and have expressed why <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/heres-how-iphone-app-store-ratings-work-hint-they-dont/">numerous times</a> in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">the past</a>. It is ridiculous that we can rent movies on our iPhones that have nudity and graphic violence, but can&#8217;t have apps that offer the same. Actually no, it&#8217;s not just ridiculous, it&#8217;s hypocritical. I understand why that was the case before there were parental controls, but now they&#8217;re in place and Apple is still banning <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/yep-iporn-is-here-for-the-iphone/">applications</a> that it has no business banning left and right when it offers movies with the same stuff.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s store and they can do what they want. And if they don&#8217;t want hardcore porn apps, that&#8217;s fine — they also don&#8217;t sell hardcore porn movies. They do sell plenty of rated-R movies though, yet restrict many apps that would obtain a similar (or possibly even lighter) rating.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90889" title="2370011973_35d89103d2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2370011973_35d89103d2.jpg" alt="2370011973_35d89103d2" width="300" height="285" />That being said, I think Calacanis&#8217; point about how ridiculous it would be if Microsoft approved every app for Windows is a bad one. It&#8217;s not like Apple restricts applications for OS X on its Macs; doing that would cause an uproar just like it would on Windows. But the mobile space is different because it&#8217;s so new when it comes to apps. Microsoft is going to restrict apps that can be on Windows Phones. They won&#8217;t be as strict as Apple, but they will still have restrictions, just as Android does.</p>
<p>The mobile app world is new and still evolving. A number of Apple&#8217;s App Store rejections are ridiculous. Hell, I cover a lot of them and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/20/apple-rejects-another-app-for-using-an-icon-that-looks-like-an-iphone/">say as much</a>. But I think it&#8217;s wrong to think that Apple is doing this with malicious intent. Based on a number of conversations I&#8217;ve had with people to varying degrees in the know about Apple&#8217;s App Store, I would argue that they simply were not ready for what it has become.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that when it launched, there were just a handful of people who would check every single app that was submitted. Undoubtedly, the team has expanded quite a bit since then, but it still <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/156413699/many-of-the-mercenary-testers-i-encountered-were">very much seems</a> like they have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/who-exactly-is-in-charge-of-the-app-store-anyone/">no comprehensive strategy</a> when it comes to app approvals and rejections. Many seem arbitrary, and at the whim of the reviewers, because I believe they are.</p>
<p>When Apple VP Phil Schiller <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">wrote to Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber</a> last week about one app rejection, his last line was the most telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple’s goals remain aligned with customers and developers — to create an innovative applications platform on the iPhone and iPod touch and to assist many developers in making as much great software as possible for the iPhone App Store. While we may not always be perfect in our execution of that goal, our efforts are always made with the best intentions, and if we err we intend to learn and quickly improve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of that, I would change &#8220;if we err&#8221; to &#8220;when we err&#8221;, but it seems pretty clear that Schiller and Apple know there have been real problems with the system, and they&#8217;re attempting to correct them. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing a good enough job of that, but I have no doubt that is hard to change things on the fly with a entity that is exploding in popularity as quickly as the App Store is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an excuse for some of Apple&#8217;s poor decisions, but it is unfortunately, the reality.</p>
<p>Calacanis&#8217; solution is to give users the option to install unapproved apps as an option. That would just be a slightly easier way of jailbreaking your phone, something which is already extremely easy to do. The reason why Apple won&#8217;t do this is the same reason why it won&#8217;t open iTunes to other MP3 players. When it controls the ecosystem, it can ensure the customer experience. Something which, again, is very important to Apple.</p>
<p>That may not be what some people want to hear, but the fact is that it works well for the majority of users who have no idea about the app approval process.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90892" title="2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c.jpg" alt="2947219465_b3d7ae3e0c" width="250" height="375" />Again, this to me is just as much about the mobile landscape being a completely different one than the desktop landscape, even though they are merging. When the iPhone launched, the idea of a mobile browser was basically a joke. Sure, Opera may have been decent on Windows Mobile devices, but let&#8217;s be honest, hardly anyone was browsing the web on their phones.</p>
<p>With the iPhone, mobile web browsing has exploded. Would it be nice for Apple to let you use other browsers on your phone? Sure, but really, how much different is each mobile browser compared to another one? Some are faster at JavaScript, I guess, but all lack the bells and whistles that their desktop counterparts offer.</p>
<p>I wonder if what Calacanis is really getting at is that he wants a browser that can run Flash? I think we all want that, but Apple has decided that for whatever reason it is not going to do that. Maybe it&#8217;s waiting for the HTML 5 video capabilities to make Flash less necessary (which still seems a long ways off)? Maybe it really believes the performance is simply not up to par? Who knows. But even with another browser on the iPhone, Apple would still have to allow for plug-ins to be installed, which probably wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>As the mobile web and devices continue to mature, there undoubtedly will be a lot to be said for having other browsers on the phone. I just don&#8217;t see that as such a big issue right now.</p>
<p><em><strong>5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone</strong></em></p>
<p>I completely agree that this is ridiculous. And the fact that Google is now implementing a work-around by <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10305716-37.html">making Google Voice a web app</a> for the iPhone, shows that banning the native app is also pointless. But I believe this rejection had more to do with AT&amp;T — and certainly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/att-dont-blame-us-for-the-iphones-google-voice-ban/">more than they&#8217;re letting on</a>.</p>
<p>When Calacanis says, &#8220;<em>Or, just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they’ve BOUGHT AND PAID FOR.</em>&#8221; I would again point to that being AT&amp;T&#8217;s issue much more than Apple&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve seen that with the SlingPlayer app, which can only work over WiFi but not on AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G network because they&#8217;re concerned about the bandwidth it would use.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all paying near or over $100 a month to use the iPhone on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network. If they cannot handle the iPhone any longer — which I&#8217;ve made the argument that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">I don&#8217;t think they can</a> — then both Apple and AT&amp;T should agree to remove the exclusivity agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While Calacanis certainly has some valid points, I would argue that some of his points simply reinforce what makes Apple, Apple. By controlling the ecosystem surrounding their products, Apple ensures a great user experience for the majority of users.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s really the key point: The <em>majority</em> of users. We can bitch as much as we want about Apple&#8217;s shortcomings, but by and large the public couldn&#8217;t care less about any of it, nor do they even know about any of this stuff. Does my sister care that Apple rejected Google Voice? No, she&#8217;s never heard of Google Voice. As far as she knows, all is well in the Apple universe because she turns on her iPhone and boots up her Mac and they work, giving her an experience that she finds superior to competitors&#8217; products.</p>
<p>The fact remains that as long as the company continues pumping out high-quality products that offer this great user experience, people will buy them. Calacanis believes that cheap and stable products from Microsoft and Google will undercut Apple, but that seems to be the same thing that people have been saying for years about Apple&#8217;s products. Macs are too expensive, iPods are too expensive, the iPhone is too expensive — people are still buying them. And they&#8217;re doing so at or near record levels, which is stunning in this economy.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90887" title="698695902_cd1b9f4f01" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/698695902_cd1b9f4f01.jpg" alt="698695902_cd1b9f4f01" width="250" height="375" />He seems to be suggesting that the premium market will disappear. But again, if it hasn&#8217;t in this economic environment, I don&#8217;t see it happening. Cheap, stable and open sound great, and they are great, for some people. But others are fine with paying more for what they consider a superior experience, and they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>And while Calacanis may have spent $20,000 on Apple products over the years, everyone that is not Calacanis has spent billions upon billions more. Until those billions stop rolling in, Apple will generally stay on the same path. Despite some of the rhetoric, Apple is not a totalitarian state, it is very much a democracy. It&#8217;s just that in this democracy, people vote with their wallets.</p>
<p>None of that is to say that Apple shouldn&#8217;t fix any of its aforementioned problems. With regards to AT&amp;T and its App Store policies, it certainly needs to. But it&#8217;s humorously short-sighted to think that they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But Calacanis goes farther, &#8220;<em>Making great products does not absolve you from technology’s cardinal rule: Don’t be evil.</em>&#8221; That would seem to suggest that he believes Apple is making some of these mistakes with malicious intent. Instead, I would argue that the mistakes stem from the pursuit of making great products. They control the ecosystem because people left to their own devices would make the products less great.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something that will be hard for a lot of people to hear, let alone understand. But I do believe it&#8217;s at the core of what Calacanis thinks makes Apple &#8220;evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why much of this isn&#8217;t a case against Apple, it&#8217;s a case <em>for</em> Apple. Many of the problems Calacanis talks about simply aren&#8217;t seen as problems by Apple, and more importantly, by the public at large. Until that changes, there is no real risk to Apple.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that the only real risk to Apple goes back to the simple point: Great products. If Apple stops making products that are great, it will start to decline. If someone else comes along with a better product, Apple will decline. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>5 years ago, it was my belief that Apple offered a better product that got me to ditch my PC. And I&#8217;ll switch again from Apple if something better comes along. This isn&#8217;t some elaborate conspiracy in which Steve Jobs is tricking millions of people into buying his stuff against their will. They&#8217;re buying his stuff because it&#8217;s good. End of story.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/noiphone-215x95.jpg" width="215" height="95" />At the end of July I declared my intention to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/i-quit-the-iphone/">quit the iPhone and AT&#038;T</a>, port my mobile phone number to <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> and use any mobile device that I pleased (or lots of them at once) in the future. <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090808/p16#a090808p16">Like others</a>, I will no longer blindly follow all things Apple. Today I'm pleased to report a status update on those efforts: complete. I am no longer a member of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/i-am-a-member-of-the-cult-of-iphone/">Cult of iPhone</a>.

Porting my phone number to Google Voice was a three day process, which I was pre-warned about. The mobile carriers in the U.S. have made the porting process between them fairly easy, and it occurs over a couple of hours. But they are in no hurry to help customers move their phone numbers to Google Voice, and so it took a few extra days. Also, I'm one of the first people to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/google-voices-secret-weapon-number-portability/">port their phone number to Google Voice</a>, and there are always a few hiccups when you're a guinea pig. 

A week ago I was an unhappy AT&#038;T iPhone customer. I couldn't get cell phone reception here at my house and so I was always missing important calls.

Today I'm a happy Google Voice customer. My old mobile number, which all of my contacts already have, now rings simultaneously on my home Vonage phone and the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/21/t-mobile-will-drop-its-second-android-phone-the-mytouch-3g-this-august-for-199/">TMobile myTouch 3G</a> Android phone that I've started using (and, by the way, TMobile works just fine here at home, too). If I want to start using a new phone, I can make a switch in the settings at Google Voice and calls will ring through to that instead. no carrier will ever have a stranglehold on me again.

If I want to start using a new phone, I can make a switch in the settings at Google Voice and calls will ring through to that instead. no carrier will ever have a stranglehold on me again.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-75093" title="16" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/16.jpg" alt="16" width="206" height="480" />Not only are calls being sent to both of my phones simultaneously now, but all my voicemails are now aggregated at Google Voice and immediately transcribed and emailed and SMS&#8217;d to me (complete <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/11/grand-central-to-finally-launch-as-google-voice-its-very-very-good/">overview of Google Voice is here</a>). And since I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/google-voice-apps-for-android-and-blackberry-are-here/">Google Voice application for the Android</a>, all my outgoing calls appear to be from my existing phone number, not the one assigned to the phone.</p>
<p>Single best feature of Google Voice: Call blocking. Someone spams my SMS or calls me too much, I click a button and they can never call or SMS me again.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the downside?</p>
<p>I had to pay the AT&#038;T termination fee of $175. But that&#8217;s it. </p>
<p>And this myTouch phone (which TMobile has supplied to me for free for a test period) is an excellent piece of hardware. I believe it is superior to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/say-hello-to-the-iphone-3gs-s-is-for-screaming-fast/">iPhone 3GS</a> - it loads the camera app and video app faster, and web pages load in about 2/3 the time it takes on the iPhone/AT&#038;T (likely more AT&#038;T&#8217;s fault than the iPhone). The Android apps are far more interesting because they have the ability to integrate with any native function (so, for example, Google Voice, banned on the iPhone, has taken over the myTouch native dialer). And I can run persistent apps in the background like Google Talk, which lets me keep a chat window open to contacts all the time.</p>
<p>Google Voice really is nearly perfect. The only thing that would be better is if they became a MVNO and offered mobile services directly as well. And tethering would be a nice feature. But for now I&#8217;m extremely happy with my mobile situation. And I plan to never do business directly with a carrier again. </p>
<p>Want to port your mobile number to Google Voice and do what I&#8217;ve done? You can&#8217;t just yet, but porting <a href="http://www.google.com/support/voice/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=115102">will be released</a> later this year publicly. Prepare yourselves, and don&#8217;t sign any new long term contracts with your carrier. Life will soon be good for you, too.</p>

The official reason - <em>"It really boils down to this: for a lot of customers, 10-inch displays are the sweet spot for netbooks...Larger notebooks require a little more horsepower to be really useful."</em>

That makes absolutely no sense, since it requires no additional hardware horsepower to power a 12-inch netbook v. a 10-inch netbook. The only difference is power usage from the bigger screen.

It only costs a few more dollars to build a 12-inch v. a 10-inch netbook, and users get a bigger screen with the same performance.

In fact, Intel's official position on 10-inch netbooks is almost exactly the opposite of Dell's. Intel <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">says</a> <em>“If you’ve ever used a Netbook and used a 10-inch screen size–it’s fine for an hour.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/netbook.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot2" alt="" />Dell has retired their 12-inch Intel Atom-powered netbooks, they <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/blogs/direct2dell/archive/2009/08/08/dell-retires-the-mini-12.aspx">said</a> today. The official reason - <em>&#8220;It really boils down to this: for a lot of customers, 10-inch displays are the sweet spot for netbooks&#8230;Larger notebooks require a little more horsepower to be really useful.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense, since it requires no additional hardware horsepower to power a 12-inch netbook v. a 10-inch netbook. The only difference is power usage from the bigger screen. And the two extra inches more than makes up for the shorter battery life or slightly heavier device from packing in more batteries. It only costs a few more dollars to build a 12-inch v. a 10-inch netbook, and users get a bigger screen with the same performance.</p>
<p>In fact, Intel&#8217;s official position on 10-inch netbooks is almost exactly the opposite of Dell&#8217;s. Intel <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">says</a> <em>“If you’ve ever used a Netbook and used a 10-inch screen size–it’s fine for an hour. It’s not something you’re going to use day in and day out.”</em></p>
<p>So why is Dell <em>really</em> discontinuing 12-inch netbooks?</p>
<p>Probably a couple of reasons. First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/06/here-come-the-12-inch-netbooks-and-intel-isnt-happy-about-it/">Intel doesn&#8217;t like 12-inch netbooks</a> because they are deep into dual core territory, where Intel has much healthier profit margins. For casual users a 12-inch netbook with an Atom chip works just fine, and they are buying these devices instead of more expensive dual core machines. Intel has put pressure on OEMs to build netbooks that have 10 inch or smaller screens. </p>
<p>This includes direct pricing pressure - Intel prices Atom chips based on the size of the device screen. Anything over 10 inches is priced higher than devices with 10 inch or smaller screens. We think this is an inappropriate way to price Atom chips.</p>
<p>Dell may also be seeing customers who would otherwise buy a dual-core <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-13?c=us&#038;cs=19&#038;l=en&#038;s=dhs&#038;~ck=mn&#038;ST=dell%2013%20inspiron&#038;dgc=ST&#038;cid=36576&#038;lid=910506&#038;acd=52183,8,0,67602608,705988398,1249785662,,12057254,3333743661">13-inch</a> or <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/home/notebooks/laptop-inspiron-14/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-inspiron-14&#038;s=dhs&#038;cs=19&#038;redirect=1">14-inch</a> Inspiron choosing the lower priced (and less profitable) 12 inch netbook instead. That&#8217;s something they aren&#8217;t going to be happy about.</p>
<p>Netbooks should be getting bigger, not smaller. That&#8217;s what users want.</p>

File sharing services are not as popular today as they were four years ago. It's not that people are sharing any less. Rather, they just found easier ways to do it. Would you upload a funny video from a friend's email to any of those services or would you search for it on Youtube and share only the link? Would you upload an MP3 file in order to share with whomever, or would you search for it online, grab the link and then share it? And finally, would you use a file-sharing app just to share a picture on Facebook when you can do it directly from your desktop to your Facebook profile? Of course, you wouldn't!

So why would you use an file-sharing app anyway? Actually for many reasons: for larger files, for privacy, multiple files, file format support, and more.

In this post, I compare 16 file-sharing services.  I took three main issues under consideration when creating the comprehensive app list below: Free, Fast, and Useful . . .

<p>So why would you use an file-sharing app anyway? Actually for many reasons: for larger files, for privacy, multiple files, file format support, and more.</p>
<p>In this post, I compare 16 file-sharing services.  I took three main issues under consideration when creating the comprehensive app list below: Free, Fast, and Useful . . .</p>
<p>Most of the services suggested require no registration. None of them will ask you to download anything to your computer, and all of them are easy to use, and worth using. It is actually great to see services, such as <a title="Yousendit" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/04/i-finally-got-you-send-it-to-work/" target="_blank">Yousendit</a>, <a title="MailBigFile" href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/" target="_blank">MailBigFile</a>, and <a title="Rapidshare" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/ouch-german-court-slams-rapidshare-with-34-million-fine/" target="_blank">Rapidshare</a>, that are still relevant and are good choices, but if I had to pick one it would be <a title="Mediafire" href="http://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank">Mediafire</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get confused now.  This is not a list of services that let you store all your files in the cloud, organizes them, or allows you to collaborate with friends. It&#8217;s more focused on file-sharing only, in the richest capacity—well, okay, you be the judge of that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90746" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tcscreen1.gif" alt="tcscreen1" width="630" height="634" /></p>
<p><a title="Box.net" href="http://www.box.net/" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-90751 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11.gif" alt="11" width="100" height="56" /></a> <a href="http://box.net">Box.net</a> is probably the most commonly-known site featured here. But I couldn&#8217;t keep it from the list because it&#8217;s really a good one and despite all its features, it&#8217;s actually simple to use. The light version is not so attractive though. Here&#8217;s what you get: File uploads up to 25MB/file (OK, that&#8217;s pretty lame). 5 collaboration folders, 1GB storage, mobile access, public file sharing, folder widget, and a few more options. The other plans are far richer, but for personal use, the free one is enough (except for the lame file uploads limit). One thing that bothered me is that you can&#8217;t upload a file without signing up. That&#8217;s the old fashion way, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rapidshare.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-90754 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/15.gif" alt="15" width="100" height="67" /></a> <a href="http://www.rapidshare.com/">Rapidshare</a> is lacking in features &amp; design, but if you&#8217;re looking for a one-click file host, you came to the right place. Founded in 2006, the service is the twelfth most visited homepage in the world. With Rapidshare, users can upload big files (200MB) in one step and subsequently make them available to friends and family via the download link. Premium accounts offer additional convenience, through TrafficShare that provides the option to make files available for direct downloading. The recipient of the file can access it instantaneously even if he/she is not a premium account member of RapidShare. A file can be downloaded 10 times, and will be deleted after 90 days.</p>
<p><a href="http://drop.io/"><img class="size-full wp-image-90757 alignleft" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2.gif" alt="2" width="100" height="48" /></a> I always liked <a title="drop.io" href="http://drop.io/" target="_blank">drop.io</a> and even now with much more usage than before, it is still simple to  understand. No need to sign up in order to quickly send a private link with your file(s). Maximum file upload is 100MB, but there are three different packages that will give you a whole lot more. Back to the free service; you can share, collaborate, and present music, videos, documents, audio, in a private drop, through email, web, phone, fax, and more. Additionally, you&#8217;ll be able to privately chat with the people you share a file with, in real-time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.filedropper.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90760" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2009-08-07_175843.gif" alt="2009-08-07_175843" width="100" height="50" /></a> <a href="http://www.filedropper.com/">Filedropper</a> aims to give the most basic file hosting service that enables you to share stuff quickly. Therefore, there&#8217;s nothing complicated here, just upload the file, and share it. Simple as that. Filedropper says you can upload up to 5GB per file, which looks a bit odd to me - after all, who needs that (unless you are transferring HD videos, I guess)? Very similar to Filedropper, is <a title="FileSavr" href="http://www.filesavr.com/" target="_blank">FileSavr</a>, which offers you the same package completely, with a slight change: uploads up to 10GB per file&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://wikisend.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90762" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/4.gif" alt="4" width="99" height="38" /></a> I actually marked this one as a favorite: <a href="http://wikisend.com/">Wikisend</a> - an elegant and simple interface that helps you share files quickly. Share files with your friends using email, social networks, your blog, forums and so on. You can also protect the file with a password and choose the range of the file&#8217;s lifetime up to 90 days (max)</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.driveway.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90764" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/6.gif" alt="6" width="99" height="33" /></a> You can use <a title="Driveway" href="http://www.driveway.com/" target="_blank">Driveway</a> even without registration and send up to 500MB </span>max for each upload.  S<span>igning up for a free account offers several advantages: </span><span>A registered user can upload up to 2 GB of data to the Driveway account. </span><span>Additionally, you can upload, manage and create widgets for files and folders and search for files/folders within your account. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.send6.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90765" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/7.gif" alt="7" width="100" height="41" /></a> With the free plan of <a title="Send6" href="http://www.send6.com/" target="_blank">Send6</a>, you can send files up to 100MB size, which you can store in your 250MB free space. Send6 also has a free plug-in for Outlook that allows you to send large files directly from your Desktop. Please note that you don&#8217;t need to register to send files to friends. Sharing is done via email only.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zshare.net/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90768" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/8.gif" alt="8" width="99" height="39" /></a> <a href="http://www.zshare.net/">Zshare</a> is mainly used to share files that are too big to be sent via e-mail. With Zshare you can host files, images, videos, audio and flash in the same place, and as long as they remain active they can be downloaded limitlessly. Zshare lets you upload files up to 1GB, and if you register for the service (still free), you&#8217;ll be able to share them privately. Premium members get faster downloads (like most of the services here) and the ability to upload up to 2GB per each upload. Multiple files are allowed in both free and premium lines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.2large2email.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90769" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/10.gif" alt="10" width="100" height="27" /></a> Overall, <a title="2large2email" href="http://www.2large2email.com/" target="_blank">2large2email</a> has a nice and comfortable email-like interface for sharing large files. How large? 100MB in the free plan. However, if you&#8217;re looking for something good and free, 2larg2email is not your answer. The service won&#8217;t give you any additional features but password protection, and your files can be downloaded up to 7 times, will be saved for only 7 days, and will expire after that. For more features, you&#8217;ll have to pay, or move and chose another service. BTW, I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t pay for premium services, but if there are other services for personal use, that offer you more for less, you may want to check them out first.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.senduit.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90771" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/12.gif" alt="12" width="100" height="44" /></a> For busy people, <a title="Senduit" href="http://www.senduit.com/" target="_blank">Senduit</a> is the best choice there is! It&#8217;s a one-page platform that generates a private link from the file you upload (100MB Max) for easy sharing. You can send the link via email through Senduit&#8217;s page directly, or copy-paste the link to any other communication channel (IM, Social networks, etc.). You get to choose when the link will expire—from 30 min. to 1 week.</p>
<p><a href="http://new.flyupload.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90775" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/13.gif" alt="13" width="99" height="43" /></a>I couldn&#8217;t find the exact amount that you can upload per file to <a title="Flyupload" href="http://new.flyupload.com/" target="_blank">Flyupload</a>, but the service looks great. Flyupload allows you to store, access, share and backup your digital documents, photographs, and music easily with complete privacy online. Registered users get extra features like 2GB space of files, Multi-uploads with an upload progress bar. You can also upload large files via FTP or create folders and keep track of files and Images. Additionally, Flyupload lets you share files from your database, to your Twitter account with a side tool called: Flyontwit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90776" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/14.gif" alt="14" width="100" height="27" /></a>If I had to choose one service only from this list, <a title="Mediafire" href="http://www.mediafire.com/" target="_blank">Mediafire</a> would be it. The service has a good looking UI, with some great usability. It lets you share files even when you&#8217;re not logged in and gives you a set of tools to complete this experience. For individual use, you can freely share files up to 100MB with unlimited uploads, unlimited downloads, unlimited bandwidth, and unlimited storage. This is why you might choose Mediafire over 2large2email, for example. When signing up, Mediafire enables you to organize your files in folders, search and view your files, and email/share/embed with others. It&#8217;s the best service that you can get for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.divshare.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90777" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/17.gif" alt="17" width="100" height="45" /></a>I was surprised to see that underneath the new layout of <a title="DivShare" href="http://www.divshare.com/" target="_blank">DivShare</a> is the same <a title="great service" href="../2007/10/12/divshare-upgrades-its-one-stop-shop-free-file-hosting-service/" target="_blank">great service</a> from three years ago. And, even more surprised to discover some files I had stored 3 years ago in the service are still there! DivShare is a file management service that not only lets you share files, but also saves them for later (for an unlimited period of time). The maximum size per file is 200MB and you have 5GB space for free to start. After the upload, you&#8217;ll be able to embed your videos, audio and slide shows on any web site or profile. Diveshare has an <a title="iPhone" href="http://www.divshare.com/iphone" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and Facebook applications, a Wordpress plug-in and an open API, if you want to build something yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90779" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/19.gif" alt="19" width="100" height="40" /></a>Back when I tried <a title="MailBigFile" href="http://free.mailbigfile.com/" target="_blank">MailBigFile</a> in 2005, I thought this was a great service that offered a convenient solution to sending larger files. I still think it&#8217;s a good service. You don&#8217;t need to sign up, but if you choose to this is the best pro account for your dollar. Even though, you can use the service for free and as long as you want to send up to 200MB per file via email (but with no additional features). MailBigFile has the best price for a pro account - <a title="$15/year" href="http://www.mailbigfile.com/pricing/" target="_blank">$15/year</a> with an impressive list of features.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yousendit.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90780" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/18.gif" alt="18" width="100" height="58" /></a>Last but not least is good old <a title="Yousendit" href="http://www.yousendit.com/" target="_blank">Yousendit</a>, which has never plummeted in its presence online. A reliable and secure service since 2004 that offers the ability to send free 100MB files with a maximum number of 100 downloads allowed per file. You use it just like an email, choose a recipient, send it directly to a person&#8217;s inbox, and you get a notification when your file is downloaded.</p>
<p>Sharing files, large or small, should be a simple act, in my opinion—not something that should require a major effort or thought process on your behalf or make you create a complicated profile/account to use it. The options I listed here will help you explore the diverse file-sharing opportunities currently available. Whether you need to send a file privately or publicly, small or big, temporary or permanent, the options are all in this list, you just need to find the best match for your needs.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/blindsearch-215x116.jpg" width="215" height="116" />Have you tried out this <a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com">blind search tool</a> yet? It provides results from Google, Yahoo and Bing in three columns but doesn't tell you which column is which search engine. You then tell it which one you think shows the best results, and you then see which answers are from which engines. I keep choosing Yahoo as the best results.

A few search engine experts we've spoken with over the years say that users tend to think Google results are better just because they're from Google. If you take any search engine and put the logo on top, it tests better. So Yahoo results with a Google logo will always test better than, say, Google results with the Yahoo or Bing logo. People are just used to thinking about Google as the best search.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/blindsearch.jpg'  class=border alt='' />Have you tried out this <a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com">blind search tool</a> yet? It provides results from Google, Yahoo and Bing in three columns but doesn&#8217;t tell you which column is which search engine. You then tell it which one you think shows the best results, and you then see which answers are from which engines. I keep choosing Yahoo as the best results.</p>
<p>A few search engine experts we&#8217;ve spoken with over the years say that users tend to think Google results are better just because they&#8217;re from Google. If you take any search engine and put the logo on top, it tests better. So Yahoo results with a Google logo will always test better than, say, Google results with the Yahoo or Bing logo. People are just used to thinking about Google as the best search.</p>

<p>The score keeping feature was removed when people found a way to game it, but you can still run the test against yourself and see which search engine you really like the best.

Unfortunately, the Hudson River <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/08/hudson.helicopter.crash/index.html">accident</a> today has forced him to <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F51974CE-219B-8B95-7C1E25F612F86FBE&#38;utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=social&#38;utm_campaign=social">reschedule</a> his Twitter plans, so he can, you know, actually do his job.

So those who were hoping to know what Bloomberg was eating for lunch, what he's thinking about while walking his dogs, and updates about the Yankees game, will have to wait. Why was Bloomberg planning to tweet for the day? Well, because he's running for re-election and undoubtedly heard about the power of social media in campaigns these days.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90822" title="picture-29" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-29.png" alt="picture-29" width="143" height="262" />New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had planned to take the entire day tomorrow to use Twitter to send out mundane updates about his life. Unfortunately, the Hudson River <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/08/08/hudson.helicopter.crash/index.html">accident</a> today has forced him to <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F51974CE-219B-8B95-7C1E25F612F86FBE&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social">reschedule</a> his Twitter plans, so he can, you know, actually do his job.</p>
<p>So those who were hoping to know what Bloomberg was eating for lunch, what he&#8217;s thinking about while walking his dogs, and updates about the Yankees game, will have to wait. Why was Bloomberg planning to tweet for the day? Well, because he&#8217;s running for re-election and undoubtedly heard about the power of social media in campaigns these days.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s kind of sad is Bloomberg&#8217;s actual <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg">Twitter stream</a>. While it&#8217;s pretty clear that it&#8217;s not actually run by him right now (hence, the idea of him tweeting for the day actually being compelling), his tweet stream is filled with shameless self-promotion to follow him, and touting his day of tweeting. He #followfriday&#8217;d himself no less than <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg/status/3183835567">two</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebloomberg/status/3182662999">times</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Anyone looking at his tweet stream for information about the Hudson River accident? You&#8217;re out of luck. That might actually be useful.</p>
<p>Still, it was definitely a good call by the mayor to pass up the Twitter promotional stunt to deal with the tragedy.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pinocchio-205x200.gif" width="205" height="200" />As anyone who has read my critically acclaimed, Pulitzer-Prize-winning <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/book">book</a> will know, I have not always been the paragon of honesty I am today.

Truth be told, in the past I have been guilty of prevarication on an Olympian scale in almost all aspects of my life. In business, in relationships, in friendships and even - during one epically drunken evening in a London pub a couple of years ago - in all three at the same time, leading to hilarious consequences, no small amount of heartache and the beginning of my journey of self-improvement. It's a long story. You should <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/book">buy it</a>.

Given my past indiscretions, then, it's both perfectly fitting and deliciously ironic how much I hate being lied to. Or rather, how much I hate discovering that I've been lied to. I really can't put into words how furious it makes me; with the liar, the lie and with myself for believing them both. I could probably forgive you for cheating on my sister (I don't have a sister) or running over my cat (I don't have a cat), providing you're honest with me about it. But the moment you lie, and I find out about it, we're done.

So you can imagine how I felt this week when I found out I'd been lied to multiple times by not one but two separate people, regarding two different stories I was trying to report. I won't name names on this occasion, for reasons I'll get to, but the details are important.]]></description>

<p>Truth be told, in the past I have been guilty of prevarication on an Olympian scale in almost all aspects of my life. In business, in relationships, in friendships and even - during one epically drunken evening in a London pub a couple of years ago - in all three at the same time, leading to hilarious consequences, no small amount of heartache and the beginning of my journey of self-improvement. It&#8217;s a long story. You should <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/book">buy it</a>.</p>
<p>Given my past indiscretions, then, it&#8217;s both perfectly fitting and deliciously ironic how much I hate being lied to. Or rather, how much I hate discovering that I&#8217;ve been lied to. I really can&#8217;t put into words how furious it makes me; with the liar, the lie and with myself for believing them both. I could probably forgive you for cheating on my sister (I don&#8217;t have a sister) or running over my cat (I don&#8217;t have a cat), providing you&#8217;re honest with me about it. But the moment you lie, and I find out about it, we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>So you can imagine how I felt this week when I found out I&#8217;d been lied to multiple times by not one but two separate people, regarding two different stories I was trying to report. I won&#8217;t name names on this occasion, for reasons I&#8217;ll get to, but the details are important.</p>
<p>The first liar presented himself to me on Monday when Lacy and I were working on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/spotify-and-the-great-leaps-of-faith/">a story</a> about European music house-of-cards Spotify. Ordinarily I am more than able to resist the temptation of doing actual journalism, but a source very close to the company had reached out to me with details of their latest fundraising round and so I felt I had something uncharacteristically useful to contribute to Sarah&#8217;s solid reporting of the story. The source was willing to tell me all that he knew on the proviso that I wouldn&#8217;t quote him directly or identify him in any way. With every reason to trust him - or rather no reason not to - I agreed.</p>
<p>(Journalism students will have correctly determined that he was asking for a neat subset of &#8220;off the record&#8221; sourcing called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>. Well done journalism students, go to the top of your irrelevant class.)</p>
<p>A few hours later, as is good practise when dealing with unattributable information, I spoke to another well-placed source  for verification. &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve heard from my source,&#8221; I said, before spelling out what my Deep Throat had told me. The second source listened intently but with a look of increasing confusion spreading across her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did you get this stuff from __________, by any chance&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to talk about sources,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She laughed, for an uncomfortably long time. &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ve obviously been talking to __________. He does this all the time - exaggerates or out-and-out lies to reporters off the record, knowing he won&#8217;t be quoted. He thinks he&#8217;s some Machiavellian character but the truth is he&#8217;s just not very good at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>No. He most certainly is not.</p>
<p>Moving right along, and if you follow me on Twitter you can probably guess the identity of my second liar of the week. You might even have read the open letter I wrote to him on my blog, but let&#8217;s keep his name off TechCrunch just this once. Sufficed to say he&#8217;s someone with whom I&#8217;ve had numerous conversations - some on the record, others off - in which he&#8217;s told me his side of what is a very weird and very painful story of lies, betrayal and start-ups-gone-bad. In return I&#8217;d given him a fair hearing and, I thought, reported the facts in a way that was fair to all parties.</p>
<p>But as time went on, his version of events began to unravel. More and more independent information that I received pointed to the fact that I&#8217;d been mislead - and on a few comical occasions the liar&#8217;s new lies even began to contradict his previous ones.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously. Being fooled by one off the record liar in a week is unfortunate, two starts to look like carelessness. You can imagine how angry I felt.</p>
<p>And yet with that anger came a sudden realisation: with almost every lie I&#8217;ve ever been told professionally, the circumstances have been the same. The person telling it has always insisted on being off the record, ostensibly because the information they&#8217;re giving me is so sensitive that they would risk losing their livelihood if they were revealed as the source. But really because they are talking out of their ass with a serious agenda and don&#8217;t want to be exposed as a liar. It&#8217;s happened to me maybe fifty times, and I&#8217;m not even a real reporter.</p>
<p>What seems to have been forgotten in the past few years, by both sources and reporters, is that an off the record agreement is not a one-way deal which allows an interested party to spin a story without any risk that it will come back and bite them on the ass. Rather it&#8217;s a contract between two parties, designed to ensure that the truth can be told, in keeping with the public interest, without fear of oppression.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a way for a source to feel safe in revealing, honestly, what they know, in return for agreement that the reporter would go to jail before identifying him or her. The reporter is agreeing to take all the heat for the story; to put their ass on the line for the source - and the price of having the reporter take that risk is total honesty. Think <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100655.html">Mark Felt </a>and Bob Woodward; that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to work.</p>
<p>And yet, until now, the big difference between the &#8220;off the record&#8221; contract and any other binding contract is that the former didn&#8217;t carry any penalties whatsoever for breach. Even if all  evidence points to an anonymous source being 100% full of shit, the fact remains that the reporter has agreed in advance not to identify them. Sure, I&#8217;ll never trust either of my two liars again, but they&#8217;re still free to scamper off to another reporter and peddle the same bullshit with a decent chance it&#8217;ll be published, at least as a rumour.</p>
<p>Every technology and business reporter I&#8217;ve spoken to this week about the <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1596">off the record problem</a> has their own story to tell about bullshitting sources, and every single one says they don&#8217;t know what to do about it. They just consider it one of the risks of the game.</p>
<p>Well enough&#8217;s enough. The one-sided contract ends here.</p>
<p>From now on, if you tell me something off the record and I later discover that you&#8217;ve knowingly mislead me, our contract of anonymity is immediately void, for breach. That means that everything you&#8217;ve told me about the story becomes on the record, and fully attributable.</p>
<p>Every.</p>
<p>Single.</p>
<p>Thing.</p>
<p>I will call you out on your lies and I will embarrass the hell out of you, to the point that no reporter - or any other right-thinking human being - will ever believe a word you say ever again. If there&#8217;s any justice in the world, you&#8217;ll also be fired. And have your sister cheated on, and your cat run over.</p>
<p>This new policy starts today, and over the coming days and weeks I&#8217;ll be taking my message on the road, selling the idea to every other reporter I meet. It&#8217;s time those of us who write about business and technology begin holding ourselves to the same standards we expect from any other kind of reporting,  and it&#8217;s time to indict those backroom bullshitters who think that journalists are their own private press machines.</p>
<p>Consider yourself warned, liars. Your free ride stops here. Because God knows, if there&#8217;s one person more unwise to bullshit than a bullshitter, it&#8217;s a reformed bullshitter.</p>
<p>And, yes, you can absolutely quote me on that.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/7943solidsnakestitunesv.png" alt="7943solidsnakestitunesv" title="7943solidsnakestitunesv" width="256" height="256" class="alignright size-full wp-image-90740" />This is completely a rumor, but an awesome one. Citing a &#8220;pretty reliable&#8221; source, <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/08/08/apple-itunes-9-details-blu-ray-app-organization/">Boy Genius Report is saying</a> that the next version of iTunes will add a bunch of new, highly requested features. Specificially, BGR&#8217;s source says iTunes 9 features Blu-ray support, a new way to organize iPhone apps within iTunes, as well some kind of integration with Twitter, Facebook and possibly Last.fm.</p>
<p>Each of those features have been talked about for some time now on the web. But as BGR notes, the talk of Blu-ray does line itself up well with an <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/07/apples_next_imacs_rumored_with_compelling_new_features.html">AppleInsider report</a> from yesterday that very vaguely suggested Apple has new iMacs due shortly with features that have long been on the wish-lists of Mac owners. Blu-ray is certainly on that list, and seems like a pretty good candidate, despite Steve Jobs&#8217; calling the format a &#8220;bag of hurt&#8221; as recently as October of last year.</p>
<p>More compelling may be the talk of a new way to organize iPhone/iPod touch apps in iTunes. This has been badly needed ever since it became clear that people were downloading a ton of apps to use on one device. Currently, system for managing them within iTunes is quite franktly, awful. The concept video posted at the bottom of this story shows how it really should work.</p>
<p>BGR says the Twitter/Facebook/Last.fm stuff from its tip was more vague, but you can imagine that if such features were integrated it would involve tweeting out or updating your Facebook status with what song you are listening to. It&#8217;s possible that for Last.fm, iTunes would build-in support for logging what songs you are playing, something which Last.fm currently does through its own software.</p>
<p>The Twitter angle is also interesting because of the rumors of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/twitter-mania-google-got-shut-down-apple-rumors-heat-up/">talks between the two companies</a> a few months ago. We were unable to confirm those rumors, but perhaps the two sides did meet to talk about something like this. Obviously, that&#8217;s just speculation.</p>
<p>Apple has worked with Facebook in the past to get support for uploading pictures built-in to the newest version of iPhoto. The integration is pretty slick as it also allows you to tag Facebook friends in pictures, and keeps edits made on both iPhoto and Facebook in sync.</p>
<p>And just imagine if Apple made a feature not only to send the name of a currently playing song to Twitter and Facebook, but if it included a link to buy the song on iTunes as well. That could mean some significant sales.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re speculating, I would also love to see a Genius feature for iPhone apps, something which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/13/the-app-store-needs-a-genius-feature-asap/">I talked about the need for</a> recently.</p>
<p>Again, these are all just rumors for now, but we could see if they&#8217;re true or not as early as next month when it&#8217;s likely that Apple will hold some kind of iPod even, just like it does every September.</p>

Like so many other apps, it was starting to look like Apple simply may not accept it. But a surprise came to developers last night: An email from Apple accepting the app.</p>
<p>Now, before you get all excited, it&#8217;s not live just yet. The developers had an issue with the Amazon servers they use to run their system, so they temporarily took the app down, but the team expects things to be back to normal and the app to be in the store in the next 24 hours, we&#8217;re told. Again, as far as Apple is concerned, the app is good to go.</p>
<p>If you need to know about the app itself, I suggest you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/push-gmail-comes-to-the-iphone-—-through-an-app-if-its-accepted/">read our initial piece</a>, but it&#8217;s pretty straightforward, it brings push support to Gmail on the iPhone via Push Notifications because Apple doesn&#8217;t support push Gmail natively, for whatever reason. What we&#8217;re more interested in is the timing of this acceptance.</p>
<p>Granted, this is all speculative, but the timing of Apple accepting a Gmail push notification app that it has been sitting on for a month is curious. Earlier this week, Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">stepped down</a> from Apple&#8217;s board of directors. A few days prior to that, the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC sent letters</a> to both Apple and Google inquiring about the their relationship as it relates to the App Store. This was brought about by Apple <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejecting</a> Google&#8217;s Google Voice app. And then yesterday, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/source-apple-and-google-agreed-not-to-poach-workers/">we reported</a> that Google and Apple did have a no-poaching rule for hiring between the two companies, something which the Justice Department was looking into.</p>
<p>Could all that pressure, specifically on Apple as it relates to Google, have caused Apple to accept this app? Or, at the very least, did Schmidt&#8217;s removal from Apple&#8217;s board pave the way for this? The developers are wondering the same things. Sure, it may sound silly that Apple&#8217;s stance on one app could be changed by these things, but we do know that Apple has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/06/apples-phil-schiller-speaks-on-censored-iphone-dictionaries-but-ignores-the-bigger-issues/">started watching</a> even single app rejections/non-approvals more closely as no less than Apple VP Phil Schiller is now <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">weighing in</a> on them.</p>
<p>Or maybe this is the first sign of a thaw for Apple&#8217;s frigid policies with developers who create apps in what it considers to be a gray area. I&#8217;m not saying GPush was definitely one of those apps (though we did wonder that from day one), but a month is a long time to wait for approval, even by the App Store&#8217;s standards. And the GPush developers say that they did not change anything in the app to make Apple accept it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the acceptance, if you&#8217;re a Gmail addict, it will be a good thing to have GPush in the store. As I said, look for the app sometime in the next 24 hours in the App Store. It will be $0.99 for the first week of availability, then the price will go up to $1.99.</p>

<p>Ever since the new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/firefox-35-hits-five-million-downloads-in-24-hours-respectable-but-not-a-record/">Firefox 3.5 came out</a> about a month ago, I&#8217;ve been using it as my main browser. Generally I am very happy with it. Pages load a lot faster than they did before, the plus-sign feature in tabs which launches a new one is a godsend, and I am very excited about the prospects for all of the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/demo-firefox-35-treats-videos-like-web-pages-why-cant-flash-do-that/">open video technologies</a> built into it.  But there is one persistent bug that might push me to another browser: it keeps crashing on me.</p>
<p>This usually happens when I have too many tabs open (like 15 or 20, which is not unusual for me towards the end of the day).  The whole thing will just freeze and I&#8217;ll have to force the browser to quit.  When I relaunch I get a message like the one above, sheepishly saying, &#8220;Well, this is embarrassing.&#8221;  Yes, it is embarrassing. A modern browser should be able to handle dozens of open tabs, and if there is a problem with one, it should be able to isolate it and allow you to carry with your business in the other tabs.</p>
<p>Without basic stability, none of the other great features or add-ons really matter much. Mozilla needs to fix this issue fast because Firefox 3.5 is already gaining a lot of traction.  Net Applications has it at a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/report-firefox-35-jumps-to-45-market-share-in-a-month-ie-hemorrhaging-slows/">4.5 percent market</a> share at the end of July, while <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-daily-20080701-20090808">StatCounter has it at 9.4 percent</a> as of today.  People are using this as their main browser, despite the beta label, and there are plenty of other powerful choices out there from Safari to Chrome to, yes, even IE8.</p>
<p>I realize that Firefox 3.5 <del datetime="2009-08-08T17:34:25+00:00">is a</del> just came out of beta, and to be fair, it has become slightly more stable over the past month (it was crashing every day in the beginning, now it is just every few days).  I&#8217;ve been patiently waiting for the crashing to stop as Mozilla releases patches and updates. And I&#8217;m on a developer build, so maybe I&#8217;m just asking for crashes.  But plenty of other <a href=" http://search.twitter.com/search?q=firefox+3.5+crash">people are complaining</a> as well.  Is Firefox 3.5 crashing for you?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/iphoneshot2-97x200.png" width="97" height="200" />As one of the most popular applications on Apple's popular iPhone platform, a lot of users are eagerly awaiting the next version of the app. And that wait is almost over.

"<em>The app is pretty much done - we're just working on translating it into a bunch of languages</em>," Facebook developer <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/3188129643">wrote</a> tonight on Twitter.

That means that shortly, we'll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook's site, the ability to "like" items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">video support</a> for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly.

<p>&#8220;<em>The app is pretty much done - we&#8217;re just working on translating it into a bunch of languages</em>,&#8221; Facebook developer <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/joehewitt/status/3188129643">wrote</a> tonight on Twitter.</p>
<p>That means that shortly, we&#8217;ll have access to the much-improved app which is scheduled to have features such as a News Feed that is more like the one on Facebook&#8217;s site, the ability to &#8220;like&#8221; items and a new customizable home screen. More importantly, it will also have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">video support</a> for the iPhone 3GS, something which Hewitt threw-in at the last second, unexpectedly. And perhaps best of all, the app will have the ability to manage events, finally.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t get too worked up just yet. We asked Hewitt if &#8220;pretty much done&#8221; meant next week perhaps. His response: &#8220;<em>Can&#8217;t be sure - translating could take a while.  I&#8217;ve been avoiding predicting an actual release date</em>&#8220;. And of course even when the app is done, Facebook still has to submit it for approval in the App Store, and as we all know, that can be a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">crapshoot</a>. We could see it next week, we could see it 6 months from now. Though, Apple does seem to do a pretty good job pushing important apps like this one through quickly. Funny how that works, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Facebook is also finally working on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/pigs-fly-as-facebook-and-google-work-together-on-an-android-app/">an Android app</a>. That should drop any day now.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90699" title="2436608184_56fb589b10" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/2436608184_56fb589b10.jpg" alt="2436608184_56fb589b10" width="320" height="180" />While Google CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> was on Apple&#8217;s board of directors, the two companies had an agreement not to hire away each other&#8217;s workers, a former Google employee with knowledge of such matters has told us. We have since confirmed this with other ex-Googlers. This was not a written agreement, and was considered non-official, but it was well-known and followed within the recruitment division of Google, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>This news follows a report <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/02/AR2009060203412.html">by The Washington Post</a> in early June that the Justice Department was looking into this very issue. That report cited sources close to the investigation stating that the government was looking for possible antitrust violations among several tech companies, including Google and Apple, with regard to their hiring policies. But that report didn&#8217;t say whether or not it was actually taking place. According to our sources, it is.</p>
<p>Or at least, it was. Another interesting element to this is that the main component of this understood agreement between the two companies was Schmidt&#8217;s position with each, one source tells us. Now that Schmidt has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">stepped down</a> from Apple&#8217;s board of directors, that agreement may be off, they went on to say. It&#8217;s hard to know that for sure until actual hiring starts taking place, but one source says that both Google and Apple have been ramping up their staffing departments recently, presumably to make a bunch of hires.</p>
<p>To be clear, this unwritten agreement was that Google would not go after Apple employees, and vice versa. However, employees of both companies were free to apply to the other company on their own, we&#8217;re told. That&#8217;s a small, but important difference as the practice of going after other company&#8217;s talent, also known as &#8220;poaching&#8221;, is considered to be an important component of healthy competition in the market. That&#8217;s why the Justice Department is looking into it.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-90702" title="jobsschmidt" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/jobsschmidt.png" alt="jobsschmidt" width="331" height="249" />While plenty of tech companies have non-compete clauses that would seem to make poaching moot, both Apple and Google are headquartered in California, which is known for not recognizing non-compete portions of contracts.</p>
<p>This news comes amid much controversy between the two companies. The stated reason for Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">stepping down</a> was the growing overlap the two companies have on the product side. But the FTC was (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/ftc-commends-schmidt-for-stepping-down-then-steps-up-investigation/">and still is</a>) also looking into the overlap between Google and Apple on its board of directors. And more recently the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an inquiry</a> into the relationship between Google and Apple (and AT&amp;T) on Apple&#8217;s App Store. That followed Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of Google&#8217;s Google Voice app.</p>
<p>And it goes even deeper. A few months ago, there was <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/02/09/apple-asked-google-not-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-and-google-complied/">a report</a> (written by me, for another publication) that the reason Google didn&#8217;t put multi-touch support into its Android mobile operating system was because Apple asked it not to. More recently, Google admitted that it scrapped plans for a Latitude native iPhone app in favor of a web app because, yes, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/why-is-google-latitude-a-web-app-and-not-a-native-app-because-apple-said-so/">Apple asked it to</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both Google and Apple for comment on this latest matter, but have yet to hear back from either. We will update if we do.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We&#8217;ve just received an email from a source that would seem to very directly confirm the agreement between Apple and Google in print. We&#8217;ve removed the names, a few details that could identify our source, and exact date, but the email was sent in the summer of last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>From: XXXXX XXXXX &lt;XXXXX@google.com&gt;<br />
Date: XXXXXXX XX, 2008 X:XX:XX AM PDT<br />
Subject: Re: Google Opportunities- Follow up email&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.  I don&#8217;t believe that we have been in<br />
contact previously - apologies if I am wrong about this.</p>
<p>From your reference to the [APPLE DIVISION], I take it that you are<br />
currently working there.  If this is the case, we will not be able to<br />
proceed with your application.  Google has an agreement with Apple<br />
that we will not cold call their staff.  If you are not currently<br />
working at Apple and are interested in learning more about [A GOOGLE DIVISION]<br />
please let me know and I would be happy to chat with you.</p>
<p>Thank you again for returning my email.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Google has an agreement with Apple that we will not cold call their staff.&#8221; That would seem to once again confirm that Google was not allowed to poach Apple staff, but implies that they could have talked if it was the Apple employee who initially reached out (which wasn&#8217;t the case here).</p>

<p>We reached out to Scribd CEO Trip Adler, who says that the site is currently toning down its SEO efforts and further reducing pirated content.  He also writes that there&#8217;s a dip associated with the summer season:</p>
<blockquote><p>We made some changes that will have a short-term impact on traffic.  Primarily: 1) improving our copyright filter, which keeps unauthorized content off the site and 2) reducing the aggressiveness of our SEO, which reduces total traffic in the near term but increases the relevancy of Scribd links in search engine results 3) trending down typical in the summer time &#8212; we experienced this last year at this time and other major sites (YouTube , Google Books ) are experiencing the same.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not concerned about the dip - we expect traffic to go back up quickly.  The metrics we care about at Scribd are active members of our community and uploads of unique, authorized works.  As long as these numbers keep growing, we are positioned very well for long-term growth in unique visitors.</p>
<p>These product changes are part of a long-term strategy to focus on user experience and quality content.  We call it a &#8220;controlled growth strategy&#8221;, similar to what Facebook did a few years ago.  We have a lot product changes planned in the next few months that will increase quality / relevance / stickiness of the site.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like Scribd has some major changes coming, and it&#8217;s understandable that the site might want to prepare for those in advance.  Still, it isn&#8217;t often that you hear about a site <i>voluntarily</i> killing nearly 50% of its traffic — perhaps Scribd didn&#8217;t expect its changes to have such a major effect (it&#8217;s sort of hard to believe that they aren&#8217;t concerned about the dip).  That said, Scribd is still ranked as the 130th most visited site on the web by Quantcast, which is hardly anything to scoff at.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92337" title="3391612981_74a744b44a" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3391612981_74a744b44a.jpg" alt="3391612981_74a744b44a" width="267" height="400" />Movie piracy is a problem, but it&#8217;s not as huge of a problem as music piracy was this past decade. While certainly the size of the movie files and the need for fast broadband connections to get them in a reasonable amount of time plays into it somewhat, also helping is the fact that there are some fairly decent ways to get movies quickly, for a pretty fair price these days. And now Hollywood is apparently trying to change that.</p>
<p>The studios are starting to rally around a horrible new idea: Keeping new releases out of Redbox and more importantly, Netflix for 30 days. Let me repeat that: They think Netflix shouldn&#8217;t be able to ship many new movies to you until 30 days after they&#8217;re released on DVD.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&#8217;t appear to be set in stone yet for Netflix, as the studios are said to be currently negotiating this with the company, but it is <a href="http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6676736.html?nid=2705">what the studios want</a>. And the strategy is going forward with Redbox, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-redbox13-2009aug13,0,3034157.story">recently filed a lawsuit</a> against 20th Century Fox over the same issue. And now, with Universal and Warner Brothers <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-warner-bros.-throws-dvd-rental-gauntlet-down-at-redbox-and-netflix/">getting on board</a>, another lawsuit seems likely.</p>
<p>And in a move that couldn&#8217;t be less surprising, Blockbuster is on the wrong side of this. Despite the company having a strategy to do a massive roll-out of kiosks like the ones Redbox has, it is all in favor of the 30-day window, based on <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/08/blockbuster-q2-loss-lowers-2009-expectations.html">comments</a> CEO Jim Keyes made during its Q2 earnings call.</p>
<p>Why? Well the company once again completely bombed in those earnings, posting a net loss of $36.9 million, while overall sales fell 22 percent in the quarter. It is getting fleeced by the likes of Redbox and Netflix and needs to gain some sort of competitive advantage in movie rentals. A 30-day rental window for its stores would certainly offer that.</p>
<p>Of course, as the name synonymous with movie rentals for the past couple of decades, Blockbuster could have used its power to get ahead of some of these trends (by-mail rentals, cheap kiosks, online rentals/streaming), but didn&#8217;t. So now they will have to rely on the movie studios attempting to put stricter rules in place for gaining access to its movies right away. Rules, that would seem to be basically prodding users to obtain those movies illegally.</p>
<p>If the studios are allowing some places like Blockbuster stores to rent movies on day one, but limit Netflix from doing the same, how many of the millions of Netflix users are going to drive to a Blockbuster store to get that movie? Some certainly will, but a lot will also turn to the web and simply download the movie. And some who have never done that before will learn how to get around such a ridiculous restriction.</p>
<p>And Blockbuster&#8217;s comments on this are pitiful. Having failed so far with its movies-by-mail approach, online approach, and set-top box approach, Blockbuster is now turning to kiosks. It hopes to have some 2,500 of them by the end of the year and 7,000 of them by next year. Some of their ideas for them are pretty laughable (a good example is the digital transfer of movies to portable media players, but no iPod/iPhone support, meaning that basically no one would use them), but more importantly, Blockbuster is against the two things that made this solution work for Redbox: Availability and price.</p>
<p>Keyes comments during the earnings call indicate that he believe the $0.99 price that Redbox offers its movies for is far too low for a sustainable model. He probably doesn&#8217;t mean for Redbox&#8217;s end, because they seem to be <a href="http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6657094.html">doing just fine</a> — which is to say, just about the opposite of Blockbuster — using that model. Instead, he seems to be saying that Hollywood can&#8217;t survive on such a model, which again, is probably not true, but it&#8217;s good that Keyes is the movie studios new PR agent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best part of what he said though:</p>
<blockquote><p>A vending rental window would enhance the complementary relationship between Blockbuster stores and Blockbuster kiosks. On Fox, Universal, and now Warner titles, for example, we can be far more aggressive in filling the store shelves with product to assure 100% availability of hot new releases. After 30 to 45 days, we can then make use of that product in our vending channel at a substantially reduced cost of goods, since that product will be partially amortized. Our customers can then use Blockbuster stores for depth and breadth of selection and assurance of hot new releases being available on Friday night or Saturday night. The customer can use vending kiosks then for value and convenience.</p></blockquote>
<p>So basically, he wants to use the studio&#8217;s ridiculous 30-day window to prop up his own stores, which are flailing badly. He sees a movie rental ecosystem in which you get new releases from Blockbuster stores, and then slightly older options from the kiosks. Of course, both of those methods of getting movies are already dead, Keyes just doesn&#8217;t realize it yet.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s investing in these kiosks because Blockbuster has failed elsewhere to make inroads against competitors. But eventually, everyone knows that all of this distribution is going to go online, and then Blockbuster will be left with thousands of kiosks that are useless, just like its store are becoming. At least those won&#8217;t be the black holes for money that the stores are, I guess.</p>
<p>Supporting Hollywood&#8217;s ridiculous and dangerous idea to place 30-day rental holds on Netflix and Redbox, might prop up his failing brick and mortar stores a bit, but the idea that it will save them long term is laughable.</p>
<p>And Hollywood shouldn&#8217;t be tricked into thinking this 30-day rental window is a good idea because they have Blockbuster&#8217;s support. Blockbuster doesn&#8217;t matter anymore. And they well pay for that mistake in piracy.</p>

For the entrepreneur? Not so much. Hitherto unknown relatives, entrepreneurs seeking angel investments, money managers and supposed baby-mamas all come out of the woodwork with dollar signs in their eyes.</p>
<p>Since I <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/what-everyone-made-from-the-zappos-sale/">outed</a> their take-home pay from the Amazon merger a few weeks ago, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh and COO/CFO Alfred Lin have figured out a way to cope with this: Giving everyone my email address and telling them I&#8217;m in charge of their investments.</p>
<p>To be fair, Hsieh told me he was going to do this. He even told me they&#8217;d make an investment decision based on my favorite pitch. I just thought he was kidding. Then, two nights ago I had dinner with a Los Angeles-based entrepreneur who had &#8220;a hilarious&#8221; story to tell me. It seemed a friend at one of the more prominent Southern California investment firms was hounding him for an intro to Sarah Lacy. Clearly, this made no sense since writers don&#8217;t generate wealth. We&#8217;re lucky to pay rent and have some left over for booze. &#8220;No, I need to talk to her about managing this guy Alfred&#8217;s money,&#8221; the money manager insisted.</p>
<p>So let me be clear: I am not actually in charge of distributing that near-$400 million worth of Amazon stock, but if Hsieh is a man of his word, I will pass on the best single pitch I get in the next two weeks. Send to sarah(at)techcrunch(dot)com or leave in the comments.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the email he&#8217;s sending everyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you can probably imagine, since the Amazon announcement, I am being<br />
inundated with many requests for different opportunities, including<br />
private wealth management services, investment opportunities, and<br />
partnership opportunities.</p>
<p>To help sift through through the various opportunities, I&#8217;ve enlisted the<br />
services of Sarah Lacy. As a journalist and author, her career has been<br />
all about research and figuring out the story behind the story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked Sarah to help sift through many of the opportunities that I&#8217;m<br />
being approached with between now and August 31. In September, I will ask<br />
Sarah to present to me what she thinks the most interesting opportunities<br />
are for me to consider.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cc&#8217;d Sarah so you should feel free to email her directly.  However, I<br />
encourage you to reach out to her in whatever medium you think would allow<br />
you to best properly convey the value of your opportunity so that she can<br />
give it a fair evaluation relative to all of the other opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the contact information that Sarah has made publicly available on<br />
her web site:</p>
<p>http://sarahlacy.typepad.com/sarahlacy/contact.html</p>
<p>(For me personally, I&#8217;ve always found that talking to Sarah by phone or in<br />
person to be more effective and enjoyable.)</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding in participating in this process. I look</p>
<p>forward to hearing from Sarah her thoughts in September.</p></blockquote>

			<title>That Google Bomb Electromagnet Doodle Might Not Go Over So Well On Google Palestine.  Wait, There’s a Google Palestine?</title>

The doodle for today's Google logo might give a new meaning to the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb">"Google bomb."</a>  While it is not actually a drawing of a bomb—it is an electromagnet in celebration of the birth of its inventor <a href=" http://www.google.com/search?q=Hans+Christian+%C3%98rsted&#038;ct=orsted09ig&#038;oi=ddle">Hans Christian Ørsted</a>—a lot of people might <a href="http://twitter.com/NukeGold/status/3308342215">mistake it for a bomb</a>. It has a wire and a <del datetime="2009-08-14T16:55:18+00:00">clock timer</del> (<strong>Update</strong> that's actually a compass) and that magnet kind of looks like a stick of dynamite.

For most of the world, it is just another quirky Google doodle.  But for people in Palestine, it might just seem in poor taste.  Especially since this is one of the first things they are seeing on the new <a href=" http://www.google.ps/">Google Palestine</a> domain. Yes, there is now a separate domain for Google Palestine, it just <a href=" http://arabcrunch.com/2009/08/breaking-google-launches-a-palestinian-domain.html">launched yesterday</a>.

Nicholas Francis: Unity Technologies is the company behind the Unity gaming middleware. We have 44 employees with our development HQ in Copenhagen, Denmark. Then we have a bunch of hardcore demoscene guys in Lithuania that have forgotten more about low-level optimizations than most developers will ever know, some developers in Brighton, UK and a few hotshots that work from their respective countries. Our corporate HQ is getting moved to San Francisco - there's so much more business going on over there, that we figured it made the most sense to have business be over there but keep development in Europe.

We launched Unity 1.0 in 2005 and slowly grew it. We never had any VC backing or anything, so we've grown the company organically (by about 200% per year. these days we have over 9000 customers - pretty much spread through word-of-mouth. Basically, we're a tool by developers, for developers. Quite simple really, but our tech packs a real punch.]]></description>

This time, it’s a few weeks in Brazil. Right now, I’m planning on spending the time in Sao Paolo but am open to exploring the country further if anyone knows of great start-up activity elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m working closely with <a href="http://www.endeavor.org/ ">Endeavor</a> which has done amazing work in South and Latin America for more than a decade. But as always, I want to ferret out the best entrepreneurs and investors in the country so send me an email if you have any suggestions at sarah (at) techcrunch (dot) com.

Marc Andreessen is <a href=" http://www.techmeme.com/090814/h0920">backing a new browser company</a> called <a href="http://rockmelt.com/">RockMelt</a>.  Not much is known about RockMelt other than it is being designed by an all-star team (including software engineer Robert John Churchill from the Netscape days) and that it is tied into Facebook through Facebook Connect.  Marshall Kirkpatrick at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rockmelt_netscapes_andreesen_backing_stealth_facebook_browser.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> has a screenshot of the sign-in page and speculates that RockMelt is in fact a Facebook browser.  Miguel Helft at the NYT leans in that direction as well.  It kind of makes sense since Andreesen is on the board of Facebook, but I suspect it is only half the story.

A Facebook browser, however, is a good metaphor for thinking about how browsers, in general, need to change.  What would a Facebook browser look like?  Well, to start with, you would be able to see updates from your friends on Facebook, share your own updates and media right from the browser, and perhaps IM with your friends through Facebook chat.  While those set of features would be convenient, they are nothing revolutionary.    <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>, which calls itself the social browser, already incorporates Facebook Connect (and Twitter and other social networks to boot), but it hasn't taken off.  And Facebook itself offers a <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/toolbar/">toolbar</a> for Firefox that lets you see notifications, search Facebook, and share links.  There are plenty of other <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=facebook&#38;cat=all">Firefox add-ons</a> which incorporate Facebook features as well.

But the Facebook connection may just be the starting point for a much more ambitious piece of software. ]]></description>

There are plenty of other <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=facebook&amp;cat=all">Firefox add-ons</a> which incorporate Facebook features as well.</p>
<p>But the Facebook connection may just be the starting point for a much more ambitious piece of software.  Andreesen said as much to the NYT in an interview earlier this year, which Helft quotes from in his <a href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/technology/internet/14browser.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Andreessen suggested the new browser would be different, saying that most other browsers had not kept pace with the evolution of the Web, which had grown from an array of static Web pages into a network of complex Web sites and applications. “There are all kinds of things that you would do differently if you are building a browser from scratch,” Mr. Andreessen said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What sorts of things is he talking about?  Making the browser social appears to be at the top of the list.  The first thing you do is connect to Facebook.  But that could just be a building block for a social browser that handles Web apps in an entirely new way.  The browser was built around the Web page metaphor, but increasingly the most interesting things happening on the Web do not necessarily exist on any one Web page. They exist in real time data streams (such as Facebook&#8217;s portable News Feed and Twitter) and in richer Webtop applications.  A modern browser should be designed not only to surf the Web, but to manage your information streams and Web apps all in a seamless user interface.</p>
<p>Whether or not RockMelt is tackling this broader challenge, I don&#8217;t know.  But I hope it is because we need to move the ball forward with a radical, yet accessible, new approach.  Radical, yet accessible—that is the challenge.  It must be radical enough to open up new, more efficient, avenues of information discovery, creation, and interaction.  It must be a communications platform as well as a browsing platform.</p>
<p>The original browser model was one of consumption, of reading Web pages as if they were documents.  Despite all the progress of the past decade, we are still stuck with that legacy to a large degree because it is built into our browsers.  So what would a true social browser look like?  Below is my own wish list of features (some of these are available as add-ons or in existing desktop clients, but there is an opportunity to unify them in one seamless experience):</p>
<ul>
<li>It would have multiple modes for browsing, search, following social data stream, and launching Web applications</li>
<li>The home page would be a stream reader which brings together real time streams from across the Web (which Facebook now has with Friendfeed).</li>
<li>IM, email, and public messages (status updates and Tweets) would be always accessible in the toolbar or a sidebar</li>
<li>It would support a variety of Web apps which could be launched seamlessly within the browser without going to a Website and logging in.</li>
<li>One-button access to sharing services of your choice (Flickr, Posterous, Youtube, Wordpress)</li>
<li>Real-time search and alerts from across the Web (social stream, news, finance sites, sports sites, etc.)</li>
<li>Support for Google Gears to give the browser <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/google-gears-lets-developers-take-apps-offline/">offline</a> capabilities as well as local caching and a light database for computing tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s just off the top of my head.  If you were redesigning the browser from scratch today, what would it look like?</p>

<p>Perhaps you heard about 301works in one of our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/trim-cuts-off-bitlys-301works-idea-wants-to-sell/">recent pieces</a> about how Bit.ly was attempting to salvage the Tr.im wreckage. The idea was the 301works would be a centralized hub for all shortened URLs, not run by any one URL-shortener. Tr.im balked at the idea of joining, but plenty of others are, including Bit.ly, Awe.sm, Adjix, betaworks, Cligs, and URLizer. All of them are teaming up with <a href="http://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a> to launch this project.</p>
<p>One of the holdups in Tr.im&#8217;s participation was that it didn&#8217;t want one company ruling all of this data. And while Gnip will be handling it at first, to get the project off the ground, the plan is still to find a non-profit group to manage 301works. All the members are clear that they want this to be an open-source project that sets users&#8217; minds at ease about using URL-shorteners.</p>
<p>The service will launch sometime in the next few weeks, after the participating companies have a chance to tell their users that they will be backing up their links on 301works. While most are unlikely to have a problem with that, some might, so they&#8217;re giving them some time to opt-out.</p>
<p>So how will 301works actually work? Well here are the key points for how companies will be able to back up their links:</p>
<ul>
<li>URL shortening services decide the frequency that they will make updates.</li>
<li>URL shortening services decide how their updates can be made available to the public.  Some services will provide regular uploads and downloads (hourly, daily, weekly, etc) and some will opt for a pure archival approach.</li>
<li>Gnip is providing the infrastructure service to support aggregating data from URL shortening services.  Gnip will provide the infrastructure service to compress the data into pre-defined download options for end users.</li>
<li>Companies will be able to submit data via a REST API using HTTP POST over SSL. In addition, Gnip can provide other approaches on request.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this sounds great on paper, but the question of just how well this system works remains to be seen. Still, it&#8217;s promising that we&#8217;re seeing a bunch of companies take action on this so quickly after an incident that left a lot of people concerned about the future of URL-shorteners.</p>

<p>Is this legal? It sure is. The PACER site <a href="http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/faq.html#GP72">says</a> <em>&#8220;The information gathered from the PACER system is a matter of public record and may be reproduced without permission.&#8221;</em> There&#8217;s no copyright on these documents. </p>
<p>PACER also <a href="http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/faq.html#GP78">says</a> <em>&#8220;Any attempt to collect data from PACER in a manner which avoids billing is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal prosecution or civil action.&#8221;</em> Technically, though, the data isn&#8217;t being collected from PACER by RECAP users, although they are using the site as a search engine of sorts.</p>

You can access the new FatSecret Platform <a href="http://platform.fatsecret.com/">here</a>.

CEO Rodney Moses says that FatSecret is allowing developers to access the API for free, in the hopes of turning FatSecret into <i>the</i> reliable and accurate resource for nutritional information.  He points out the fact that while there are plenty of diet sites on the web that contain nutrition info for various foods, much of the data is disjointed — there's no established comprehensive source that people turn to first.  FatSecret hopes to become the authoritative hub for this kind of information.  The site has gathered its data from a number of publicly available resources like the USDA, and also has many user-submitted entries from users on its social network.  Moses says that all of the data has been curated to ensure accuracy.

<p>Moses says that the site itself is still growing steadily, with half a million monthly visitors and around double that number when including users who access the site through other means, like its mobile applications.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_1227.png" class="shot2"/>One of the big problems with starting a new service that relies on user submitted data is getting people to actually use it — nobody is going to routinely boot up your app if they don&#8217;t have an incentive to do so.  One way to tackle this problem is by working the service into a game, which is a technique that seems to be working quite well for   <a href="http://playfoursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, a service that makes it easy to find your friends.  <a href="http://www.graffitigeo.com/">GraffitiGeo</a> is a new <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded startup launching tonight that&#8217;s looking to combine similar gameplay elements to take on a different space: restaurant reviews.</p>
<p>At its core GraffitiGeo allows users to leave brief reviews of restaurants, or for those too lazy to do that, to simply leave a &#8216;thumbs up&#8217; or &#8216;thumbs down&#8217; — it&#8217;s like a highly condensed version of <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a>, or a &#8220;Digg for the world&#8221;.  These reviews and votes can be cast from the site&#8217;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=319494073&#038;mt=8">iPhone app</a> or from the service&#8217;s homepage.  The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments.  There&#8217;s also a nifty feature that lets you view a <a href="http://www.graffitigeo.com/heat">heatmap</a> of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.</p>
<p>The gameplay in GraffitiGeo is a bit more complex than that found in Foursquare, which gives you points for checking in but doesn&#8217;t really let you <i>do</i> anything with them.  With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment.  Once you&#8217;ve reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a &#8216;mob&#8217;, which you can invite your friends to join.  Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks.  Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too.  It&#8217;s definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay — something that Foursquare lacks. You can read more about the mob game <a href="http://graffitigeo.posterous.com/a-memo-for-future-mob-leaders-on-graffiti">here</a>.</p>
<p>GraffitiGeo is also working on a second related iPhone app that combines the site&#8217;s data with augmented reality — in effect, it turns your iPhone into a viewfinder for looking up restarurant info (see the video below for a demo).  Just hold the iPhone as you would a camera and point it in the direction of the restaurant in question, and an overlay featuring GraffitiGeo comments will hover over it.  It&#8217;s very cool (we&#8217;ve seen a number of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/crashcorp-demos-augmented-reality-iphone-application/">other</a> AR apps that are on the way), though we&#8217;ll have to wait a while longer to try it out.</p>

</center></p>
<p>GraffitiGeo has some good ideas (especially with the AR app), but it still has its work cut out for it.  For one, Yelp is going to prove a very tough competitor — it already has a vast amount of data, and while it may be annoying having to sift through long reviews at times, I don&#8217;t think people find it annoying enough to stop using that site.  The startup also has some work to do on the iPhone app and the service&#8217;s homepage, both of which are functional but could still use some polish.</p>

<p>So far, my best effort (below) is called &#8220;Dictionary.com Cheer Carrot Theme&#8221; after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/dictionarycom-now-a-giant-web-billboard-your-ad-here/">my new favorite website</a>. To FriendFeed&#8217;s credit, they make it pretty hard to make a truly ugly design, like you can easily do on Gmail. One reason is that theren&#8217;t are as many variables to change the colors of.</p>
<p>One interesting note about these themes is that by default, you will see other users&#8217; themes when you click on their profiles. You will also see the themes that admin&#8217;s create in rooms that they manage. You can turn this off, and choose to only see your theme, in the settings.</p>

<p>And just for comparison sake, the old Gmail design I did:</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/scvngrshot.png" class="shot2"/>For many people, the term &#8220;Scavenger Hunt&#8221; conjures childhood memories of running around the neighborhood on a quest for knickknacks like thimbles and socks — an experience that loses its luster beyond the age of ten or so.  But as it turns out, they&#8217;re big businesses: major corporations and universities have successfully used more elaborate scavenger hunts as team building exercises, and a well-designed course can be extremely fun.  <a href="http://www.SCVNGR.com">SCVNGR</a> is one young startup that&#8217;s managed to tap into this niche market very successfully, and today it&#8217;s launching a new consumer platform that will allow anyone to build their own scavenger hunts, which will work with any mobile phone.  The new platform, called XPLR, is now in private beta, and the first 100 TechCrunch readers to go <a href="http://www.scvngr.com/xplr/beta_register.php">here</a> and enter the code &#8216;TECHCRUNCH&#8217; will be able to sign up and build their own missions.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the news, the company is also announcing that it has closed a $750,000 funding round from Highland Capital.</p>
<p>SCVNGR is still a very new company, making its debut last fall as part of the <a href="http://www.dreamitventures.com/">DreamIt Ventures</a> incubator program.  But it&#8217;s already seen use by over 300 universities, including Harvard and Princeton, as well as corporations, who have used the company&#8217;s enterprise-grade game builder for things like employee team building excercises and orientation events.  It&#8217;s a fantastic idea for a number of reasons: games are easily deployable with little to no cost outside of licensing the platform, it works on any cell phone, and games can be tweaked with a minimal amount of effort. </p>
<p>XPLR (pronounced &#8216;explorer&#8217;) is meant to serve as a more accessible framework to build these games.  And, unlike the more robust SCVNGR builder, XPLR is free.  It comes with a number of restictions: you&#8217;re limited by how many people can play the game simultaneously, you can&#8217;t tell which users have been playing (as you might want to in a commercial app), and the platform is only for non-commercial, non-institutional use.  But if you wanted to set up a tour of your hometown, or perhaps a barcrawl for your friends to follow, this is exactly what you&#8217;d want to use.  You can see a screenshot of the editor below.</p>
<p>So how do the games actually work?  If you&#8217;d like to try one out for yourself, there&#8217;s a free <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=323248984&#038;mt=8">application</a> for the iPhone that includes a training game, but here&#8217;s the gist of it: the service sends questions to the phone, oftentimes alongside a text, audio, or video clue to help figure out the answer.  Once you think you&#8217;ve solved it, you type in your solution and if you&#8217;re right, you proceed to the next question.  The system works fine as a basic puzzle game, but it&#8217;s far more engaging when it&#8217;s used for scavenger hunts, with questions that require you to actually walk to a certain landmark.  For example, there are a number of SCVNGR missions set up for the <a href="http://www.boston.scvngr.com/">city of Boston</a>, which guide users through some of the city&#8217;s most well known landmarks.  Here&#8217;s an example series of questions, taken from a Philadelphia tour:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Clue</b>: Which is greater? This stairs in this famous staircase in Philadelphia or the sequels in this never-ending saga?<br />
<b>Answer</b>: Rocky Steps<br />
<b>Challenge</b>: Great! Now run there and tell me, on the statue of Rocky at the top, what size shoes is he wearing?<br />
<b>Answer</b> (obtained by looking very carefully at Rocky&#8217;s shoes): 9.5<br />
An alternate challenge could have been: Now take a photo of your and your team doing the Rocky Pose at the top! Send in the photo to move on!</p></blockquote>
<p>SCVNGR offers apps for iPhone and Android, but they&#8217;re also playable on more basic phones too using SMS (just sent a special keyword to the company&#8217;s shortcode and the game will start sending you clues).  That said, the smartphone experience is definitely better: some games include multimedia clues, and there are also special photo missions that ask users to submit pictures of themselves doing various tasks.  These photos get uploaded to the site&#8217;s server, and whoever is running the mission can then distribute them as mementos later on.</p>
<p>SCVNGR is really doing a great job with its service, and its impressive roster of customers is a testament to that.  We&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on them in the future.  </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pthead-160x200.jpg" width="160" height="200" />We guard the final 50 new products and startups that launch at <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com">TechCrunch50</a> closely, and don't let anyone know the final list until the day of the event (not even press gets the list). But we also generally pre-announce one of the presenting companies to give the audience a taste of what's to come. 

And this year, I'm very proud to announce that <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com">Penn &#038; Teller</a> will be launching a new consumer tech product at TechCrunch50.

The duo has worked together for 30 years, and in September they'll be celebrating their fifth year as headliners in their own theater at the Rio All-suite Hotel &#038; Casino, as well as two Emmy nominations for one of my favorite shows, their Showtime series “<a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do">Penn &#038; Teller: Bullshit!</a>” (I even embedded a clip of their show in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/26/we-put-pepsis-ridiculous-new-aquafina-product-to-the-test/">this post about bottled water</a>).

Plus, Penn Jillette will be on stage showing their new product for the first time to the 2,000 or so people who will be at TechCrunch50. And I think you're going to love it.

<blockquote>Right now, there's a gap in the market, as it relates to making it easy to add persistent location to mobile apps.  We're simply addressing that gap by providing an end-to-end location solution for app developers. Part of that solution will include developing SDK's for mobile devices, that will allow app developers to quickly add new ways to view location data.</blockquote>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-66-215x160.png" width="215" height="160" />In its developer Google Group, Twitter has just made the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/1e07e332ec3d449d?pli=1">announcement</a> that it is releasing an early preview of a brand new API: The retweeting API. And that's not all, Twitter is in the process of completely revamping its retweet functionality.

From the looks of it, this could mean some pretty big changes on Twitter. As you can see in the mock-ups above and below, the retweet (written as "RT" in most tweets) is no longer a part of the actual tweet itself, but rather is a link below the tweet. While that certainly is a cleaner way of doing things, it will be interesting to see if this makes retweeting less or more enticing. And it could potentially help users find new people to follow (more on that below).

But as co-founder Biz Stone notes on the Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/project-retweet-phase-one.html">blog</a>, the current method of retweeting on twitter.com is a cumbersome process of copying and pasting.

In its developer Google Group, Twitter has just made the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/1e07e332ec3d449d?pli=1">announcement</a> that it is releasing an early preview of a brand new API: The retweeting API. And that&#8217;s not all, Twitter is in the process of completely revamping its retweet functionality.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this could mean some pretty big changes on Twitter. As you can see in the mock-ups above and below, the retweet (written as &#8220;RT&#8221; in most tweets) is no longer a part of the actual tweet itself, but rather is a link below the tweet. While that certainly is a cleaner way of doing things, it will be interesting to see if this makes retweeting less or more enticing. And it could potentially help users find new people to follow (more on that below).</p>
<p>But as co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/biz-stone">Biz Stone</a> notes on the Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/08/project-retweet-phase-one.html">blog</a>, the current method of retweeting on twitter.com is a cumbersome process of copying and pasting. They want to change that. He calls this &#8220;Phase One&#8221; of &#8220;Project Retweet,&#8221; and notes that it is going out to developers first so they can be ready for the change, and indicates that it&#8217;s not quite ready for prime-time:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are still sketching out exactly how this feature and its API counterpart works. Sharing our thoughts before launching means developers will have the opportunity to prepare their applications. In a few weeks or so we&#8217;ll launch the feature on our web site and because app developers had a chance to prepare, it should become available across most of the Twitter ecosystem about the same time. This way, we can all enjoy retweeting—however we choose to access Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92111" title="retweet" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/retweet.png" alt="retweet" width="320" height="240" />And the ramifications of this are potentially even larger. With the new method, all of your friends will see the original tweet you&#8217;re retweeting in their timeline (unless they have this option turned off). So if I&#8217;m not following <a href="http://twitter.com/ev">@ev</a> (Twitter co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/evan-williams">Evan Williams</a>) in the example that Stone drew to the right, I will still see his tweet in my stream because Stone retweeted it. This seems like a great idea for new follower discovery.</p>
<p>Stone notes that the new retweet look will launch to a limited group of users first for a set period of time so the team can test how it will work on the system. It will then get a wider roll-out in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Writes Twitter developer Marcel Molina in the Twitter developer Google Group about the new API:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retweeting has become one of the cultural conventions of the Twitter experience. It&#8217;s yet another example of Twitter&#8217;s users discovering innovative ways to use the service. We dig it. So soon it&#8217;s going to become a natively supported feature on twitter.com. It&#8217;s looking like we&#8217;re only weeks away from being ready to launch it on our end. We wanted to show the community of platform developers the API we&#8217;ve cooked up for retweeting so those who want to support it in their applications would have enough time to have it ready by launch day. We were planning on exposing a way for developers to create a retweet, recognize retweets in your timeline and display them distinctively amongst other tweets. We&#8217;ve also got APIs for several retweet timelines: retweets you&#8217;ve created, retweets the users you&#8217;re following have created, and your tweets that have been retweeted by others.</p></blockquote>

<p>And today brings more people backing that up. <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2009/08/13/sources-confirm-no-apple-tablet-at-sept-event-coming-in-2010/">Sources tell The Loop</a> that the tablet will definitely <em>not</em> be a part of the September event (which is likely to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/">focus on music and the iPod</a>, just like all other Apple September events do). Jim Dalrymple writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very reliable sources familiar with the product have said speculation of the tablet being introduced during the September event are flat out wrong. The Apple tablet, they said, would not see the light of day until the first part of 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>In linking to Dalrymple&#8217;s piece, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/13/insider-eh">Daring Fireball says</a> basically the same thing, &#8220;<em>I’m almost certain there’s no tablet coming this year. It’s a 2010 thing,</em>&#8221; writes John Gruber, who also has a very good track record on these types of things.</p>
<p>The point is that while all indications are that a tablet (or <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/large-form-ipod-touch-to-launch-in-fall-09/">large-form iPod touch</a>) is coming from Apple, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/report-the-large-form-ipod-touch-apples-tablet-on-track-for-early-2010/">2010 seems like</a> a much more likely launch window. Apple has spent the past couple of years doing smaller, more focused events centered around specific product categories. A September event with an Apple Tablet would simply overwhelm the other announcements they plant to make there, like the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/happy-hour-cocktail-is-all-about-the-benjamins/">&#8220;Cocktail&#8221; project</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">iTunes 9</a> and entirely <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/prepare-yourself-for-ipod-video/">new</a> iPod touches.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;d bet on Apple doing another special event in the first quarter of 2010, focused around this new device and maybe previewing the iPhone 4.0 SDK which this thing may have something to do with (just a guess there). Remember, Apple isn&#8217;t doing Macworld this year, so it doesn&#8217;t necessarily even have to be in January, but rather they&#8217;ll wait until they&#8217;ve perfected it. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/videos-probably-fake-apple-tablet-in-action-but-awesome/">Whatever <em>it</em> is</a>.</p>

<p>There are ads, and the there are ADS. <a href="http://dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> now features the latter, in what I can only describe as the most in-your-face advertisement I have ever seen on the web. About the only thing that could catch your eye more is if its next ad is for a porn or dead kittens.</p>
<p>Very clearly, the washing detergent Cheer is now sponsoring Dictionary.com&#8217;s homepage, but I&#8217;ve never seen a site with an ad so big that I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s actually a service being offered at all. <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a> features huge pictures on its site too, but they&#8217;re tasteful images that provide a nice backdrop, this is just God-awful. And worse, the entire thing is clickable, to take you to Cheer&#8217;s page.</p>
<p>This make the huge ads that MySpace and IMDb run (shown below), look tasteful. And it almost makes me forgive ESPN.com for its <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/01/05/i-will-not-be-visiting-espncom-ever-again/">greedy advertising practices</a> — almost. And yes, it&#8217;s kind of like Pandora, but you listen to Pandora, you don&#8217;t have to look at it. </p>
<p>I know times are tough, and everyone including us needs to sell ads to make the business work, but come on. At what point do you stop being a service and start being a billboard?</p>
<p>Luckily, if you are actually able to find the text input box to look up a word, the resulting page doesn&#8217;t feature the same ad backdrop. Unfortunately to do this initial search, you have to visit the page. Which I probably won&#8217;t be doing anymore.</p>

August is a horrible time for tech. There's not much out there right now, just a few headsets and some early back-to-school stuff. The retail refresh hasn't hit - that comes in about October - and the Interwebs are quiet. It's great to have a little bit of frisson in our lives, something to put on our Christmas lists. 

With that we present today's Tapplet rumors. First, we have rumor of a <a HREf="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090813/here-it-comes-but-what-is-it-exactly-apple-plans-keynote-event-for-september/">September 8event</a> at Apple HQ for music devices. This is Apple's traditional time for releasing new music gear. It's just before back-to-school and it gives them a little time to get stuff into the retail space by October, just when kids are starting to break the iPods they got last year. So what could it be? Could it be a new iPod? iPods with cameras? Or it might be...

Well, they've succeeded in the first part, but the second? That could be much more difficult.

Microsoft's new device sounds great: OLED screen, HD radio, HD video (720p) outputs, powerful Tegra chip, and most importantly a iPod-beating price of $219.99 for the 16 GB variety, and just $289.99 for the 32 GB version. That latter is a $110 savings over the comparable iPod touch, which the Zune HD clearly targets. And now it has a very real release date: About a month from now, September 15.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090813/p19#a090813p19"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92015" title="platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg.jpg" alt="platinum-zune-hd-rm-eng-gg" width="360" height="206" />A lot of people</a> today are excited about the new Zune HD. And that&#8217;s great news for Microsoft, as it has been attempting for a few years now to even just steal some buzz from Apple in the MP3 market, if not sales. Well, they&#8217;ve succeeded in the first part, but the second? That could be much more difficult.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s new device sounds great: OLED screen, HD radio, HD video (720p) outputs, powerful Tegra chip, and most importantly a iPod-beating price of $219.99 for the 16 GB variety, and just $289.99 for the 32 GB version. That latter is a $110 savings over the comparable iPod touch, which the Zune HD clearly targets. And now it has a very real release date: About a month from now, September 15.</p>
<p>Are the planets aligning for a hit version of the Zune, finally? Not so fast.</p>
<p>Apple typically takes the first week of September to hold a press event to show off its new iPods. Last year, the event was on Tuesday, September 9. This year, that same second Tuesday is on September 8. Music industry sources <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090813/here-it-comes-but-what-is-it-exactly-apple-plans-keynote-event-for-september/">tell MediaMemo&#8217;s Peter Kafka</a> that Apple is going to hold an event the week of September 7. Bingo.</p>
<p>So yes, it looks very likely that Apple will hold its next iPod press event one week before the launch of the new Zune. And what does that likely mean? Aside from Apple likely talking about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/happy-hour-cocktail-is-all-about-the-benjamins/">the &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; music format</a> project it has been working on, and quite possibly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/itunes-9-blu-ray-and-app-organization-and-twitter-oh-my/">a new social iTunes 9</a>, also very likely to drop are the new iPod touches. Yes, the device the Zune HD is competing against. Uh oh.</p>
<p>Why uh oh? Well because while the Zune HD looks good compared to the current iPod touch, the new versions will certain be seeing some upgrades. What are the two most likely upgrades? <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/prepare-yourself-for-ipod-video/">A camera</a>, which the Zune HD doesn&#8217;t have. And a price drop. Again, uh oh.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/13/zune-hd-ipod-touch">Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber has</a> some inside information here or if he&#8217;s just making a prediction, but what he writes today certainly sounds like it could be the case for the new iPod touches:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Zune HD prices look good compared to today’s iPod Touches, but not so much compared to the new camera-equipped ones Apple is set to announce next month (16/32/64 GB for $199/299/399).</p></blockquote>
<p>That would make the Zune HD 32 GB only $10 cheaper than the comprable iPod touch. And again, with no camera, and no apps (at least not yet anyway). The Zune HD could still very well hold an edge with an OLED screen (it&#8217;s not clear if a new iPod touch would feature that) and the HD-outputs, but would that really be enough to dethrone the dominant player in the market?</p>
<p>Look, the Zune HD does sound very nice, and I&#8217;ve said as <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/04/a-zune-with-100-less-suck.html">much</a> <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/05/zuuuunnnneeehd.html">many</a> times. But the overall idea of the Zune is still <a href="http://parislemon.com/2009/07/the-turning-of-microsofts-massive-cargo-vessel.html">a bit odd to me</a>. It&#8217;s Microsoft burning money to compete in a market (MP3 players) that is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/the-ipod-as-we-know-it-is-dying/">slowly fading away</a>. Now, there is undoubtedly a plan to get apps on it eventually, and I&#8217;m sure games, to turn it into more than an MP3 player. But right now, there is basically no mention of any of that by Microsoft. So that means that when it does happen, it will likely be months from now.</p>
<p>And even with those, the bigger question remains: What&#8217;s the end game here for Microsoft, which makes its money off of Windows and Office?. </p>
<p>My point is that Microsoft has spent the entire lifespan of the Zune chasing Apple&#8217;s tail, for what? The first hard drive-based Zunes came years after the iPod, and didn&#8217;t sell well. Then it released a Flash memory version well after the first flash iPods, and that too didn&#8217;t sell well. Now it has an iPod touch competitor 2 years after the iPod touch was released. On paper, it sounds promising right now, but come September 8, it&#8217;s likely to be one-upped by Apple yet again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see how this plays out, sometime next year we&#8217;ll hear about a new Zune HD that has a camera and has app support. The question is will the Zune HD have made any headway into Apple&#8217;s market by then? That is far from a certainty, despite the nice-looking new device.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d really like to know is who plans these events for Microsoft? How on Earth didn&#8217;t they not realize that Apple has an iPod event pretty much every year now in the first few days of September? I&#8217;m sure it would have been a big pain in the ass, but why not put everything you have into ramping up production earlier and getting it to market before Apple can respond?</p>

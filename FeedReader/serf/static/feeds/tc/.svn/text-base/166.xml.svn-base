					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bystander.png" class="shot2"/>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention to the tech news at all over the last week, you&#8217;re already very familiar with the outrage that Apple has sparked over its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection</a> of Google Voice for the App Store, and its ban of all third-party applications that tap into the service.  But now the fallout of the Google Voice debacle is having an impact on even more independent developers — Apple is apparently holding off on approving applications that could even be tangentially related to Google Voice.</p>
<p>The application is question is Line2, which was built by <a href="http://www.toktumi.com">Toktumi</a>, a startup that specializes in helping small businesses use their mobile phones and computers to create office-grade phone systems, even when their employees are scattered across the country. Line2 would allow users to use two different numbers with their iPhones — one which they could hand out for business calls, and the other for personal.  This setup would allow employees to keep their personal numbers private, and also allows businesses to set up professional features on the business line, with features like an phone directory (&#8221;Press 1 for sales&#8230;&#8221;) and a single support number that calls the mobile phones of multiple employees.  Given how many businesses are adopting the virtual office approach, there&#8217;s little doubt that this technology could prove very popular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Line2 is currently sitting in App Store limbo.  The app&#8217;s developers intitally submitted it on June 5th, and it sat for weeks waiting for approval with no information other than Apple&#8217;s automated &#8220;this app is requiring unexpected additional time for review&#8221; messages.  Finally, on June 23, Toktumi learned that the application had been rejected because it required people to pay through its website rather than Apple&#8217;s subscription services that are integrated with the iPhone 3.0 update.  Toktumi attempted to point out that Salesforce was allowed to offer an application that conducted transactions through the web, but in the end it decided to simply modify the app to comply with Apple&#8217;s requests.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-113.png" class="shot2"/></p>
<p>The company submitted a new version of the Line2 app on July 13, at which point it was asked to submit a demo account for testing (the company had already submitted one).  To no one&#8217;s surprise, they got another Email a few days later stating that the process would require additional time.  And then the Google Voice bomb <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">dropped</a>.  Apple removed every related app on the App Store, citing the rationale that they duplicated existing iPhone functionality and would confuse users.</p>
<p>CEO Peter Sisson was understandably concerned.  Line2 doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with Google Voice, but it does make use of so-called &#8220;virtual numbers&#8221;, which relay calls made to one number (like your business line) back to your iPhone number.  And it also offers other telephony features that &#8216;duplicate&#8217; what&#8217;s offered by the iPhone.  So Sisson reached out to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/philip-schiller">Philip Schiller</a>, Apple&#8217;s SVP of Worldwide Product Marketing, who has previously dealt with developers on an individual basis when application approvals have taken unusually long.  Sisson sent his Email to Schiller on July 27th — nearly two months since the app was originally submitted.</p>
<p>Schiller responded, stating that he would get back to Sisson by July 29th.  That didn&#8217;t happen.  Sisson sent another message to Schiller with a number of reasons why Line2 was actually <i>good</i> for Apple (it encourages small businesses to use the iPhone) and also pointed out why it wouldn&#8217;t cut into AT&#038;T&#8217;s revenues (the app doesn&#8217;t offer any SMS functionality at all, and all calls are still performed using standard AT&#038;T minutes).  Schiller hasn&#8217;t responded, and Apple has gone almost totally silent on the matter with no other response than that the application is &#8220;still in process&#8221;.</p>
<p>At this point, I doubt Sisson will be getting a response any time soon.  If Apple did grant approval to the app, it would show that duplicating functionality wasn&#8217;t really Apple&#8217;s reason for banning Google Voice (of course, countless other apps mimic portions of the iPhone&#8217;s functionality).  That kind of inconsistency would be nothing new to the App Store, but now that the FCC is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">launching</a> an inquiry into the marketplace&#8217;s approval processes, you can be sure that Apple isn&#8217;t keep on taking any chances.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that Apple has never established consistent guidelines for developers to follow.  That may change soon: the FCC inquiry may force them to change their ways, especially if the process is revealed to be as chaotic as most developers suspect.  Until that happens though, we&#8217;re only going to keep hearing of more causalities of the App Store&#8217;s black box.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-11-166x200.png" width="166" height="200" />So, by now you've probably heard that Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">resigned from Apple's board</a> of directors this morning. You'd think that this would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">the end</a> of the FTC investigation into the close ties between Apple and Google, right? Wrong.

The FTC has released a statement commending Schmidt and Apple's mutual decision for him to step down, but it warns that the investigation is not over yet. Here's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/googlestmt.shtm">their exact wording</a>:
<blockquote>“We have been investigating the Google/Apple interlocking directorates issue for some time and commend them for recognizing that sharing directors raises competitive issues, as Google and Apple increasingly compete with each other,” said Bureau of Competition Director Richard Feinstein. “We will continue to investigate remaining interlocking directorates between the companies.”</blockquote>]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-89147" title="picture-11" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-11.png" alt="picture-11" width="262" height="314" />So, by now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">resigned from Apple&#8217;s board</a> of directors this morning. You&#8217;d think that this would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">the end</a> of the FTC investigation into the close ties between Apple and Google, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>The FTC has released a statement commending Schmidt and Apple&#8217;s mutual decision for him to step down, but it warns that the investigation is not over yet. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/googlestmt.shtm">their exact wording</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have been investigating the Google/Apple interlocking directorates issue for some time and commend them for recognizing that sharing directors raises competitive issues, as Google and Apple increasingly compete with each other,” said Bureau of Competition Director Richard Feinstein. “We will continue to investigate remaining interlocking directorates between the companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So what gives? Well first of all, Schmidt is hardly the only tie between the two companies. <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/genentech">Genentech</a> CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/arthur-d-levinson">Arthur Levinson</a> remains on the board for both Apple and Google. While his conflict is obviously not as big as Schmidt&#8217;s was, it wouldn&#8217;t be all that surprising to see Levinson leave one of those board seats now that Google and Apple have businesses that are increasingly <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/googles-chrome-os-bomb-has-minimal-fallout-on-apple/">overlapping</a>.</p>
<p>Also interesting is the tie between former Vice President <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/al-gore">Al Gore</a> with Apple and Google. While he resides on Apple&#8217;s board, he also serves as a senior advisor to Google. And he&#8217;s a partner at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers">Kleiner Perkins</a> which has ties to both Apple and Google.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the overlap in people. What this really boils down to is what, if anything, the two companies are doing with regards to their products to be anti-competitive.</p>
<p>There has been no shortage of talk and speculation that Apple and Google have worked together behind the scenes on some key deals. One of those was <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/02/09/apple-asked-google-not-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-and-google-complied/">multi-touch support in the Android</a> operating system. Google has so far not included it in Android, and it was supposedly done because of an agreement with Apple.</p>
<p>Also, Google recently revealed that it had made a Google Latitude app for Apple&#8217;s iPhone, but that it instead turned it into a web app <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/why-is-google-latitude-a-web-app-and-not-a-native-app-because-apple-said-so/">at Apple&#8217;s behest</a>. The reason was that Apple said it too closely resembled its own Maps application — which Google also helped create.</p>
<p>And now we have the whole Google Voice situation. Apple <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected</a> the Google Voice app and removed all the related apps that it had previously accepted. And things get even more complicated when you consider that while AT&amp;T is issuing what appear to be <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/03/paczkowski-att">non-denial denials</a>. A few sites, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">including this one</a>, have heard that AT&amp;T <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/28/att-app-store">played a role</a> in that. The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC is looking into the matter</a> separately from the FTC, but obviously, it&#8217;s at least somewhat related.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the fallout from this continued investigation? Probably not too much. As we said, Levinson may have to choose a side and step down from one board. But it seems like if that happens, Gore could be safe, since he&#8217;s not technically a part of the &#8220;interlocking directorates,&#8221; as the FTC puts it.</p>
<p>And as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">we wrote back in May</a> when the FTC first launched this investigation, Schmidt was probably safe at the time, and it was more of a warning shot. And given his statement about having no plans to leave Apple&#8217;s board a few days later, he clearly thought so too. But then <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Chrome OS happened</a>, and that changed everything. Schmidt was already excusing himself from the part of Apple meetings where they discussed the iPhone (because of Google Android), and now he would have likely had to do the same with OS X (because of Chrome OS). That&#8217;s what Apple CEO Steve Jobs more or less said in his statement this morning.</p>
<p>But it seems like it&#8217;s this Google Voice business that really pushed the situation over the top. Not only was the FTC looking into the relationship between the companies, but now the FCC is. The fact that the FCC investigation was launched on Friday and this news comes to following Monday, seems to say a lot. Schmidt was always going to have to leave Apple&#8217;s board because of Chrome OS, but that is still months away. The FCC investigation seems to accelerate the departure process.</p>
<p>The main goal of the FTC investigation was obviously Schmidt, which is why it released the statement today. But unless they find evidence of collusion in continuing the investigation, its part of this should conclude. But the FCC investigation will remain <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">a very interesting one to watch</a>.</p>

While the site itself appears to be loading (though very slowly), numerous buyers and venders are reporting that sales are not going through. A <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=paypal">quick scan of Twitter</a> tells the same story. And it looks like it has been down for something like an hour and a half now.

Here's what PayPal is officially saying on its <a href="http://developer.paypal-portal.com/t5/Live-Site-Status/Live-Site-874-2-Update-Website-Payments-and-API-s-are/ba-p/146548">developer site</a>:]]></description>

<p>There&#8217;s a mad rush of tips coming into us right now that PayPal&#8217;s online purchasing service is down for the count. While the site itself appears to be loading (though very slowly), numerous buyers and venders are reporting that sales are not going through. A <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=paypal">quick scan of Twitter</a> tells the same story. And it looks like it has been down for something like an hour and a half now.</p>
<p><em>[Update below, it looks like after something like 2 hours of downtime, the service is starting to come back.]</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what PayPal is officially saying on its <a href="http://developer.paypal-portal.com/t5/Live-Site-Status/Live-Site-874-2-Update-Website-Payments-and-API-s-are/ba-p/146548">developer site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>EVENT DETAILS<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Service: Live Site</p>
<p>During the time listed below you may have or currently are experiencing the following:<br />
Buyers may experience error &#8220;Sorry - your last action could not be completed&#8221; on trying to login to www.paypal.com.<br />
Payments via API are intermittently unavailable.</p>
<p>Affected Product(s):<br />
- Website<br />
- PayPal APIs</p>
<p>Start Time: Aug 03, 10:15 AM PDT (Aug 03, 6:15 PM BST)</p>
<p>End Time: On-Going</p>
<p>Our technical teams are working diligently to resolve the issue. We will provide updates until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>We apologize for any impact caused by this incident.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
PayPal Merchant Technical Services</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you go, both the main site and the all-important PayPal APIs are not working. Not good.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how PayPal follows this up. A lot of merchants undoubtedly lost a lot — and I mean a lot — of money today. When Rackspace had its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/30/what-went-down-at-rackspace-yesterday-a-power-outage-and-some-backup-failures/">recent</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/yes-rackspace-is-down-and-so-are-many-of-your-favorite-sites/">failures</a>, it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/someone-needs-to-stop-tripping-over-the-power-cord-at-rackspace/">noted</a> that it would likely have to reimburse customers to the tune of millions of dollars. eBay, which owns PayPal, could be looking at a similar situation.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As of noon PT, things are starting to come back online. Here&#8217;s the update from PayPal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Update: This notification is to inform you that we have started recovering. Some intermittent issues remain which we are currently addressing.</p></blockquote>

But there's a potentially hotter Netflix streaming rumor floating around out there right now: That it's coming to the iPhone.

Multichannel News <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/blog/BIT_RATE/20671-Netflix_to_Stream_Videos_to_iPhone_Nintendo_Wii_Source.php">wrote a story</a> a few days ago that Netflix's Watch Instantly streaming service would soon have an app in Apple's App Store as well be available on the Nintendo Wii, citing an industry executive familiar with Netflix's plans. Both of these devices would seem to play well into Netflix's strategy of getting its service on as many consumer devices as possible (already it's on the Xbox 360, Blu-ray players, the Roku box and built into a few TVs). But this rumor is interesting for a few reasons.

But there&#8217;s a potentially hotter Netflix streaming rumor floating around out there right now: That it&#8217;s coming to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Multichannel News <a href="http://www.multichannel.com/blog/BIT_RATE/20671-Netflix_to_Stream_Videos_to_iPhone_Nintendo_Wii_Source.php">wrote a story</a> a few days ago that Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly streaming service would soon have an app in Apple&#8217;s App Store as well be available on the Nintendo Wii, citing an industry executive familiar with Netflix&#8217;s plans. Both of these devices would seem to play well into Netflix&#8217;s strategy of getting its service on as many consumer devices as possible (already it&#8217;s on the Xbox 360, Blu-ray players, the Roku box and built into a few TVs). But this rumor is interesting for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, Netflix on the iPhone would be awesome, but you have to wonder if Apple wouldn&#8217;t worry about it cutting into services it already provides. That has been the basis for a few app rejections, and it would seem that with on-demand movie streaming, it would remove at least some of the need to buy movies for your device through iTunes.</p>
<p>Second, talk of the service coming to both the iPhone and the Wii is interesting because of Netflix CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reed-hastings">Reed Hastings</a>&#8216; position on Microsoft&#8217;s board of directors. While I&#8217;m sure Netflix&#8217;s overall agenda is outside the influence of Microsoft, remember that Netflix streaming is currently only available on Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360, and none of the other gaming consoles. This is a big advantage for it in terms of being a living room entertainment hub (which all of the consoles aspire to be).</p>
<p>And one would have to imagine that Microsoft would love to see a Netflix streaming app on its Windows Phones (the artists formerly known as Windows Mobile phones) before it sees it on iPhones. I&#8217;m not saying that will happen, but that it may come up between Hastings and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, if such an app were to exist, it would undoubtedly bring up the AT&amp;T bandwidth restriction debate again. While AT&amp;T and Apple allow apps like MLB At Bat to stream video over the network, other apps, like SlingPlayer, are restricted to stream video over WiFi only. AT&amp;T has stated that it doesn&#8217;t want all this video streaming to further clog its pipes, which is also why it would likely restrict <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/17/hulu-for-the-iphone-yes-please-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up-just-yet/">a Hulu app</a> that was rumored a few months ago.</p>
<p>But streaming over WiFi is significantly less interesting than being able to do so over 3G. If a Netflix streaming app were to be released and limited to WiFi, you can be sure it wouldn&#8217;t dampen the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">booing of AT&amp;T</a> that has been going on recently. The fact of the matter is that eventually apps such as this are going to need to work over cellular networks and not just WiFi.</p>
<p>Again, the existence of a Netflix streaming app on the iPhone is very much a rumor based on one source, but it is interesting for the potential can of worms it opens.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tommyspace-215x171.jpg" width="215" height="171" />Anyone see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_People">Funny People</a> this weekend? One of the best movies I've seen this year, despite the 10 minute MySpace commercial in the middle of it. 

The two main characters, Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen, visit MySpace for a $300,000 paid comedy gig. Among a variety of <em>"f**ck Facebook, In the Face"</em> jokes (said two or three times. really) was some really good material, including Rogen asking <em>"I wonder if <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson">Tom</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/craig-newmark">Craig</a> from Craigslist would ever get in a fight....Who's tougher? Tom has more friends...Craig has weirder friends though. Craig has friends that are willing to do a lot more for cash, I'll say that."</em>

Sandler also <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#038;videoid=60651520">says</a> <em>"They say the more friends you have on MySpace the less friends you have in real life."</em> 

MySpace cofounder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson">Tom Anderson</a> was also <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&#038;videoid=60855846">on set</a> and part of the movie, and has now officially been <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027526/">mixed up</a> with another Tom Anderson on IMDB. Overall it was an amazing commercial for MySpace. The company says they did not pay for the placement.

<p>It really was an excellent movie, and it was no. 1 in the U.S. over the weekend with $23.4 million gross. At 140 minutes long, though, you need to be prepared for a long one.</p>

Over the past few years we've seen 3-D panoramic photographs become popular on the Web.  These are photos taken with special 360-degree cameras and stitched together to mimic the experience of moving through space.  If you've ever used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View</a> feature in Google Maps, you know what a 3-D still photo looks like.  But what if Google Street View used video instead of still photos?  You'd end up with <a href="http://www.yellowbirdsdonthavewingsbuttheyflytomakeyouexperiencea3dreality.com/">YellowBird</a>.

YellowBird is a startup in the Netherlands which has developed its own interactive 3-D video technology, including a 360-degree video camera, software to take the data captured by the camera and stitch it together, and a video player that allows anyone to navigate the video by dragging their mouse around.

<p>Over the past few years we&#8217;ve seen 3-D panoramic photographs become popular on the Web.  These are photos taken with special 360-degree cameras and stitched together to mimic the experience of moving through space.  If you&#8217;ve ever used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View</a> feature in Google Maps, you know what a 3-D still photo looks like.  But what if Google Street View used video instead of still photos?  You&#8217;d end up with <a href="http://www.yellowbirdsdonthavewingsbuttheyflytomakeyouexperiencea3dreality.com/">YellowBird</a>.</p>
<p>YellowBird is a startup in the Netherlands which has developed its own interactive 3-D video technology, including a 360-degree video camera, software to take the data captured by the camera and stitch it together, and a video player that allows anyone to navigate the video by dragging their mouse around.  I&#8217;ve embedded an example video below.  The controls can sometimes be a little overly sensitive, but you&#8217;ll get the idea.  It is a much better experience than navigating through still photos.  It really gives you a sense of walking through a crowd and swiveling your head around.</p>
<p>The startup wants to custom develop 3-D immersive videos for marketing campaigns, and that is probably a good way to make money right now.  But eventually it might be better off creating a platform so that anyone can make similar videos with standard off-the shelf cameras and software. </p>

What happens when the enemy of your enemy is no longer your friend?  You cast him out, as Steve Jobs seems to have done to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">today resigned his seat from Apple's board</a>.  An alliance which began with a mutual distrust of Microsoft is now under strain because of a mutual distrust of each other.  Google is not so much the enemy of Microsoft as it is the enemy of the old model of device-centric computing which <em>both</em> Microsoft and Apple represent.

The announcement comes on the heels of an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">FCC investigation</a> into Apple's iPhone App Store that was announced on Friday evening.

<p>What happens when the enemy of your enemy is no longer your friend?  You cast him out, as Steve Jobs seems to have done to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-resigns-from-apple-board-surprised/">today resigned his seat from Apple&#8217;s board</a>.  An alliance which began with a mutual distrust of Microsoft is now under strain because of a mutual distrust of each other.  Google is not so much the enemy of Microsoft as it is the enemy of the old model of device-centric computing which <em>both</em> Microsoft and Apple represent.</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the heels of an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">FCC investigation</a> into Apple&#8217;s iPhone App Store that was announced on Friday evening. The subject of that investigation is nominally the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejection of a Google app</a>, Google Voice, from the App Store, but it is really an investigation into the closed and arbitrary nature of how apps get approved for the iPhone.</p>
<p>In other words, Google brought down the disapproving scrutiny of the FCC onto Apple on Friday night, and on Monday morning Schmidt resigned.  It is difficult not to make a connection between these two events.  The FCC investigation, of course, is never mentioned in the press release (that would only invite more pesky questions from the FCC).  Instead, what Steve Jobs does say in the press release is that Google&#8217;s entry into mobile operating systems with Android and desktop operating systems with Chrome OS is increasingly becoming a &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; for Schmidt.  As a result, Schmidt had to go.  It also says that both executives &#8220;mutually decided&#8221; it was time for Schmidt to resign.  (I can only imagine how that conversation went. Jobs: &#8220;You are going to have to resign.&#8221;  Schmidt: &#8220;Okay, but can I say it was my idea?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Regardless of how the resignation came about (maybe it was the other way around with Schmidt telling Jobs that the two companies were increasingly coming at odds with each other), what made the two men come to grips with reality all of a sudden?  If nothing else, last Friday&#8217;s letters from the FCC was a wake-up call to Apple that Google stands on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to the evolution of the mobile Web.  Google wants the mobile Web to be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">as open as the Internet</a>.  It&#8217;s entire mobile strategy is predicated on open access for all apps, devices, and services because that creates a larger, more vibrant, and more <em>searchable</em> mobile Web.  </p>
<p>Apple is not about being open.  It never has been. Every app on the iPhone (all 50,000 of them) must be approved individually, for instance.  This difference in approach wasn&#8217;t a problem until Google started to have mobile aspirations of its own.  Asked to choose between furthering Apple&#8217;s mobile agenda or Google&#8217;s, Schmidt must choose Google&#8217;s. It is his fiduciary duty.  That conflict is only going to grow. And that is perhaps why Jobs says his &#8220;effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished.&#8221;  Also, the more they compete, the more they expose themselves to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">antitrust questions from the FTC</a> as long as Schmidt remains on the board.  </p>
<p>Schmidt had to go.  Not just because of the dust-up with the FCC and the Google Voice app.  But because Google has a different set of agendas which already are putting strains on the relationship. Google wants to diminish the importance of any single computing device in favor of Web apps which sit in the cloud and are accessible from <em>all</em> devices—mobile phones, Macbooks, Dell laptops, or whatever.  As much as is physically possible, it wants to replace the operating system with the Web.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is a bigger threat to Apple than Microsoft ever was.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/goog-appe.png" class="shot2" />Lots of people will be arguing today that this was inevitable, but the news comes faster than expected. Google CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> is no longer going to sit on Apple&#8217;s Board of Directors, nearly 3 years after accepting a seat.</p>
<p>The resignation comes a few days after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">the FCC sent letters</a> to Google, Apple and AT&#038;T <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/why-the-fcc-wants-to-smash-open-the-iphone/">inquiring</a> why <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">Apple denied the Google Voice application</a> from its iPhone App Store.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/08/03bod.html">statement</a> on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple today announced that Dr. Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Google, is resigning from Apple’s Board of Directors, a position he has held since August 2006.</p>
<p>“Eric has been an excellent Board member for Apple, investing his valuable time, talent, passion and wisdom to help make Apple successful,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “Unfortunately, as Google enters more of Apple’s core businesses, with <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/android">Android</a> and now <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Chrome OS</a>, Eric’s effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished, since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, we have mutually decided that now is the right time for Eric to resign his position on Apple’s Board.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Google has provided us with the following statement from Schmidt:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have very much enjoyed my time on the Apple Board.  It&#8217;s a fantastic company.  But as Apple explained today we&#8217;ve agreed it makes sense for me to step down now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hardly surprising, and it&#8217;s good to see both come clean on the situation: you can <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/08/googles-chrome-os-bomb-has-minimal-fallout-on-apple/">argue</a> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/11/google-stealing-apples-ideas-and-other-tales-of-accidental-corporate-espionage/">all</a> you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/04/about-schmidt-does-the-ftc-really-think-apple-and-google-are-too-buddy-buddy/">like</a>, but Google&#8217;s foray into the mobile and computer operating systems, the two products mentioned in the statement (not to mention Chrome in the browser space), must have been quite the thorn in Apple&#8217;s and Jobs&#8217; side. And I&#8217;m quite certain that the whole Google Voice App / FCC debacle only made the process a bit speedier.</p>
<p>Many people have always found it strange that Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board, but back in August 2006 when he took the seat Google had virtually nothing even remotely competing with Apple&#8217;s core products and services. It&#8217;s only in the last 20 months or so that possible conflicts of interests really became an issue, and we can&#8217;t forget that Schmidt was consequently asked to leave board meetings when critical things were shared about Cupertino&#8217;s plans for the iPhone and the App Store.</p>

Twitter is getting a <a href="http://wthashtag.com/Sept2nd">ton</a> of spam tonight for the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23sept2nd">#sept2nd</a> along with vague sounding warnings about something bad happening on that date.

What is it? Some 4Chan users are <a href="http://img.4chan.org/b/res/150104125.html">trying</a> to stir up some good old fashioned fear.

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11-215x190.jpg" width="215" height="190" />News broke last week that the latest developer builds of Chrome include <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10299814-92.html">support for themes</a>. And a few sites even found a couple of them that you can easily install right now using special links. But links are a less than ideal way of installing these themes since you can't see what they look like before you turn them on. Luckily, Google appears ready to launch a theme directory for the skins.

The site, which will reside <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">here</a>, is not live yet. But on the default new tab/new window page, the one with the thumbnails of your most visited sites, if you click on the "X" to remove some of them, a themes page shows up as a thumbnail (see included screenshot).]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88960" style="border: 1px solid gray" title="11" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11.jpg" alt="11" width="399" height="354" /></a>News broke last week that the latest developer builds of Chrome include <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10299814-92.html">support for themes</a>. And a few sites even found a couple of them that you can easily install right now using special links. But links are a less than ideal way of installing these themes since you can&#8217;t see what they look like before you turn them on. Luckily, Google appears ready to launch a theme directory for the skins.</p>
<p>The site, which will reside <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">here</a>, is not live yet. But on the default new tab/new window page, the one with the thumbnails of your most visited sites, if you click on the &#8220;X&#8221; to remove some of them, a themes page shows up as a thumbnail (see included screenshot).</p>
<p>When you click on the thumbnail, it takes you to the not-live-yet page. But the thumbnail clearly shows this page will have a bunch of themes for Chrome. My superior counting skills tell me there are 24 themes shown in that thumbnail alone.</p>
<p>This little trick to get the themes directory thumbnail to show up works in the latest developer builds of Chrome for both Windows and Mac (I haven&#8217;t tried it on Linux).</p>
<p>Speaking of Chrome for Mac, it continues to come along nicely, with limited <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/01/dont-look-now-but-flash-is-kind-of-working-on-chrome-for-mac/">support for Flash</a> just being added recently. We&#8217;re told it&#8217;s working in the Linux build as well. Alongside themes, improved support for extensions is included in this new Chrome build.</p>
<p>Themes have been available on Chrome for a while, but they used to require you to download files and know which folder to drop them in. It was also hard to revert to the original one. This latest build allows for push-button skinning and an easy way to revert. You can find two of the Chrome themes on <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/extensions/">this page</a> (theme.crx is &#8220;Camo,&#8221; theme2.crx is &#8220;Snowflake&#8221;). Click on them and then click &#8220;download&#8221; on the next page from within the new build of Chrome to install them.</p>

First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Google announced Chrome OS</a>, the company's first operating system. Then Microsoft <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/why-chrome-os-now-because-microsoft-office-in-the-cloud-comes-monday/">announced</a> the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/the-complete-guide-to-microsofts-office-2010/">new version of Office</a> with major cloud app support. Then Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-the-most-important-facts-and-some-opinion/">its deal</a> to take over Yahoo's search business. Starting today, Google is back on the offensive, with a major promotional campaign to get the word out about organizations switching to Google apps for their daily computing needs.

The campaign, called "<a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/gogoogle.html">Going Google</a>," has a very clear target: Microsoft Office. A series of advertisements [<em>disclosure: including on this blog</em>] will begin touting how and why some 3,000 organizations are signing up to use Google apps each day. But the crown jewels of this campaign will be billboards on four major U.S. highways that will give a new message about Google apps everyday for a month.

The billboards will be placed on the 101 in San Francisco, the West Side Hwy in New York, the Ike in Chicago, and Mass Pike in Boston. Google says that the vinyl being used to create these new messages each day will be recycled or reused into either computer bags or shopping bags.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-88947" title="picture-2" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-2-630x377.png" alt="picture-2" width="378" height="226" />Microsoft and Google have seen their rivalry kicked up a notch in recent weeks. First, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">Google announced Chrome OS</a>, the company&#8217;s first operating system.

Starting today, Google is back on the offensive, with a major promotional campaign to get the word out about organizations switching to Google apps for their daily computing needs.</p>
<p>The campaign, called &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/gogoogle.html">Going Google</a>,&#8221; has a very clear target: Microsoft Office. A series of advertisements [<em>disclosure: including on this blog</em>] will begin touting how and why some 3,000 organizations are signing up to use Google apps each day. But the crown jewels of this campaign will be billboards on four major U.S. highways that will give a new message about Google apps everyday for a month.</p>
<p>The billboards will be placed on the 101 in San Francisco, the West Side Hwy in New York, the Ike in Chicago, and Mass Pike in Boston. Google says that the vinyl being used to create these new messages each day will be recycled or reused into either computer bags or shopping bags.</p>
<p>Google says that so far over 1.75 million businesses, schools and organizations have signed up to use the various combinations of Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and the other Google apps. But that is of course a drop in the bucket compared to the number of companies that use Microsoft Office and its other enterprise solutions. Now, Google is clearly trying to be proactive in telling people why its solution is better before Office goes online in a big way with the 2010 version.</p>
<p>Google is also attempting to use the viral message platform of choice these days to spread the &#8220;Going Google&#8221; message: Twitter. At the bottom of its blog post on the matter, Google urges people that use its apps to &#8220;Tweet your story&#8221; and provides a link to auto-populate a tweet with the #gonegoogle hashtag. You can also follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/googleatwork">GoogleAtWork</a> Twitter account to follow the Gone Google stories.</p>
<p>It has also set up a site to &#8220;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/googleapps.com/go-google/">Spread the word</a>&#8221; about Going Google. This is similar to what Mozilla has long been doing to promote Firefox — and it&#8217;s worked to the tune of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/firefox-should-hit-1-billion-downloads-any-day-now/">over a billion downloads</a>. The site has a range of options for letting your company or organization know that you want it to &#8220;Go Google,&#8221; including things like fliers and pre-populated emails to send out.</p>
<p>And Google is also promising to give away &#8220;goodies&#8221; each week in August to users who have Gone Google and fill out a Google Doc describing their experience.</p>
<p>Will any of this work? Who knows. But I know that I can&#8217;t wait to see how Microsoft responds in this back-and-forth war. &#8220;Stay With Office&#8221; blimps, perhaps?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ryan-spoon">Ryan Spoon</a>, formerly the Vice President of Marketing &amp; Business Development at <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/">Widgetbox</a>, is joining Polaris as a senior associate, with Dog Patch Labs being one of his key areas of focus. Like other senior associates, Spoon will also be helping to generally assess investment opportunities and work with portfolio companies, but he will be working out of the Dog Patch Labs at Pier 38 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Polaris general partner <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-hirshland">Mike Hirshland</a> describes the space, which they share with the startup <a href="http://socialmedia.com/">Social Media</a>, as sort of a &#8220;frat house for geeks.&#8221; It offers space for promising young entrepreneurs to work out of, giving them desks, bandwidth, lunch and coffee. And it offers all of this for free, with no commitment to Polaris required. The idea is that many of these startups aren&#8217;t quite at the investment-ready yet, but they can use the labs to work towards that.</p>
<p>Hirshland expects Spoon, who is also the founder of the sports social network <a href="http://www.ingamenow.com/">InGameNow</a> and the high school althete college recruiting service <a href="http://www.berecruited.com/">beRecruited</a>, to be a great resource for the entrepreneurs that hang out at the Dog Patch Labs. And he certainly has the right experience for the labs, Spoon is also the founder of <a href="http://www.sfentrepreneurs.com/">sfEntrepreneurs</a>, and SF-based collective for young entreprenuers. He also worked at eBay for nearly 5 years as the manager of the Internet marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://ryanspoon.com/blog/2009/08/02/joining-polaris-ventures-partners/">Spoon&#8217;s own post</a> on the move.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: And as a few readers have pointed out, it&#8217;s definitely worth noting that Spoon&#8217;s father, Alan Spoon is a general partner with Polaris Ventures.</p>

Unfortunately many people, particularly in poorer areas, find their credits dwindle toward zero with alarming frequency.  Enter <a href="http://www.aryty.com">Aryty</a>, a new startup that's looking to help mobile phone users in India and the Phillipines by giving them a highly efficient way to receive money from their loved ones abroad.


Aryty CEO Nils Johnson says that it is quite common for families in America who have loved ones in the Philippines or India to send money on a fairly regular basis as a reminder that they're thinking of them.  But standard wire transfers, especially for small amounts of money, tend to be highly inefficient because of the way fees are structured — you might pay in excess of $10 in fees for a wire transfer of only $20.

Unfortunately many people, particularly in poorer areas, find their credits dwindle toward zero with alarming frequency.  Enter <a href="http://www.aryty.com">Aryty</a>, a new startup that&#8217;s looking to help mobile phone users in India and the Phillipines by giving them a highly efficient way to receive money from their loved ones abroad.</p>
<p>Aryty CEO Nils Johnson says that it is quite common for families in America who have loved ones in the Philippines or India to send money on a fairly regular basis as a reminder that they&#8217;re thinking of them.  But standard wire transfers, especially for small amounts of money, tend to be highly inefficient because of the way fees are structured — you might pay in excess of $10 in fees for a wire transfer of only $20. </p>
<p>In contrast, Aryty has no fees.  Families can send money directly into the cellular accounts of their loved ones without losing anything in the process, which makes it more appealing for these &#8216;thinking of you&#8217; transfers.  To initiate a transfer, you simply enter your credit card information, and the credit is instantly added to the cellular account of your loved one abroad (they also receive a SMS message alerting them to the addition).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Aryty users will send relatively small amounts of credit on a regular basis — say, once a month or every two weeks.  The reason for the fairly small amounts is that most carriers in India and the Philippines don&#8217;t allow for &#8216;roll-over&#8217; credit, which means any excess amount left at the end of the month will expire.  Fortunately, Aryty also offers a scheduling feature that lets you send money as often as you&#8217;d like without having to remember.</p>
<p>Aryty has forged deals with major carriers in the Phillipines, and is now expanding into India, where it expects to have support for around 98% of the market by the end of the year.  And while Aryty doesn&#8217;t charge any fees, it can still make money — carriers sell the company minutes at a discount, which it can then resell at the standard rate.  Carriers like Aryty because it lowers user churn (users don&#8217;t want to switch carriers after they&#8217;ve established accounts that their family members are depositing money into).</p>

Leonard has also previously worked at eBay and Intuit, and has founded two other companies.</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s 11 p.m. on a Sunday night when I notice that Twitter founder @ev has <a href="http://twitter.com/ev/status/2865919308">just tweeted</a> about <a href="http://www.twables.com/fb140">FB140</a>, our company <a href="http://www.twables.com">Twables&#8217;</a> days-old service that helps you find your Facebook friends on Twitter. Since our launch, I&#8217;ve felt like a surfer, waiting for a wave of users to start using our service. A few smaller waves have trickled through in our first days since launch, but Ev&#8217;s post represents something totally different.  I mean, here&#8217;s someone who has more than a million followers and receives personal messages from Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p>I was beyond excitement until I realized a tweet from @ev has the force of nuclear explosion.  And a nuclear explosion makes a very, very big wave. I quickly IM&#8217;d my only developer to warn him. Then I ran a Twitter search on Ev&#8217;s tweet and saw that it was getting retweeted. A lot. Between midnight and 6 a.m. alone, 170 people had retweeted him. &#8220;Frak,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;we might not scale.&#8221; For the next six hours, my developer began spinning up machines on Amazon, reworking our code and rolling it out overnight as we tried to ride the wave without having it crash down upon us. By then, we were doing more traffic in an hour than we had all week. Fortunately, he&#8217;s a killer Java programmer, and we&#8217;ve stayed afloat so far. By 6 a.m., exhausted, I reflected on three things I&#8217;ve learned since stumbling into development on the Twitter platform just two months ago.</p>
<p>1. Business hours are dead. 24/7 is the new 9 to 5. Real-time messaging means that anyone can start talking about your product at any time and that talk can snowball before you know it. I happened to see Ev&#8217;s post nine minutes after he sent it, but what if I hadn&#8217;t checked Twitter at all? Our site would have been down and a golden opportunity missed. As much as I love all the new technology (Amazon Web Services, Twitter APIs, Google Apps) that makes it possible for a two-person company to operate, it&#8217;s tough, if not impossible, for two people to be on call at all times. Perhaps this means that business guys like me are going to have to start wearing ops pagers (what? business people actually earning their paycheck?). How can you sleep for fear that someone will say something to tens of thousands of people that you really need to respond to. Is our only solution to never go to sleep?</p>
<p>2. The Borg has finally arrived. On Friday afternoon, I popped my head into Dave McClure&#8217;s office to shoot the breeze and mentioned a thought that Twitter was a bigger threat to MySpace than to Facebook. Before the words were out of my mouth, he had tweeted it, Dave-style. Instantly, people started to respond with their thoughts, and I realized that Dave was crowdsourcing our discussion before he&#8217;d even formed his own opinion. Will we all use the real-time world to have conversations? While Dave has the unfair advantage of a lot of followers, most of you are just at the beginning of your Twitter experience. I predict that you&#8217;ll join the Borg soon enough. The reality is that many of you are accustomed to asking those around you for advice. The difference is that now you&#8217;ll be able to accomplish your information-gathering process in minutes instead of weeks. Our company gets advice from users within hours of our initial launch and we are able to release changes for those users on the same day. If the dialogue with customers is now real-time, then the process of incorporating feedback needs to be real-time, too.  Sorry big companies, life is about to suck for you!</p>
<p>3. The Patriot Act can&#8217;t hold a candle to Citizen Paparazzi. An hour before Ev&#8217;s post, I was talking to two friends about Twitter. They mentioned that a friend of theirs had tweeted about their two-year-old son a few times, which they characterized as an &#8220;unusual&#8221; experience. Celebrities will finally have their revenge as two out of every three of your neighbors starts tweeting about everything you&#8217;re doing. The Supreme Court will have to revisit the definition of &#8220;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8221; when a father&#8217;s kid tweets that daddy is reading Playboy in the bathroom. (That happened to a buddy of mine. Not to me. A buddy of mine.) This may not seem like a new phenomenon, what with YouTube videos and the like already starting this trend. However, the pace at which things spread is now so close to real-time that it almost erases the line between past and present.  Real-time communication invites the world to experience your life with you, as it happens.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the world after Twitter will be better or worse. (For me, I think it will be better.) But when your tidal wave approaches, will you be ready to ride it?</p>

"I agree on the one condition it's not going to be a girl power post, ok"? That's what Gali Ross requested when I asked to profile her for TechCrunch.  So this isn't going to be a 'girl power' post, but the fact of the matter is that female entrepreneurs are a rare breed. Let's all try a mental game together… How many female startup CEO's can you name off the top of your head?  I am embarrassed to say that I have trouble coming up with more than a handful, but I don't think I am alone.   

Here's what I find strange about all this: I speak to VC's and private investors regularly, and have never EVER heard anyone comment negatively on deal-flow based on the entrepreneur's gender. Startups—at least this has been my experience—are weighted on the merits of the product, market and the team, but never on gender. Frankly, I can't explain why female entrepreneurs are a rare commodity in our industry. (Feel free to enlighten me about the gender bias underpinning the tech industry in comments).

The situation in Israel is not much different. But it should only be the quality that counts... To that end, here are three Israeli female entrepreneurs worth keeping tabs on:]]></description>

I am embarrassed to say that I have trouble coming up with more than a handful, but I don&#8217;t think I am alone.   </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I find strange about all this: I speak to VC&#8217;s and private investors regularly, and have never EVER heard anyone comment negatively on deal-flow based on the entrepreneur&#8217;s gender. Startups—at least this has been my experience—are weighted on the merits of the product, market and the team, but never on gender. Frankly, I can&#8217;t explain why female entrepreneurs are a rare commodity in our industry. (Feel free to enlighten me about the gender bias underpinning the tech industry in comments).</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is not much different. But it should only be the quality that counts&#8230; To that end, here are three Israeli female entrepreneurs worth keeping tabs on:</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/amit_knaani.jpg" alt="Amit_Knaani" title="Amit_Knaani" width="333" height="500" class="alignright size-full wp-image-88873" /><strong>Amit Knaani</strong> is best known in the Israeli startup industry as the former Senior Product Manager of Wix.com. She quit the hot startup to join forces with Yami Glick, another well-known figure in the local startup scene. Together the two founded <a href="http://www.vikido.com">Vikido</a>, a video messaging service designed to allow kids (3-9) and their parents to send and receive video messages using an an interface with no reading prerequisites.</p>
<p>A mother of two girls (hence her familiarity with the need for such a product), Amit has been in our little industry for 10 years now, starting as a photo editor at Israel&#8217;s largest news site <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il">Ynet</a>. She then moved on to manage the biggest medical site in Israel <a href="http://doctors.co.il/">doctors.co.il</a>, doing everything from spec&#8217;ing to selling media to business development. It was there that she started thinking about the idea for Vikido, mostly due to gaps of communication experienced by sick kids (information, connection with friends and parents). </p>
<p>By then it was clear to her that she wanted to be involved in consumer products with strong community reach and the ability to make an impact on people and what they do on the web. That&#8217;s when the Wix gig came about. </p>
<p>Team Vikido is planning to launch its product in September. In the mean time they are hustling to get funding, writing code, and chronicling the trials and tribulations of startup life in a weekly article series on Ynet called &#8216;The Transparent Startup&#8217;.</p>

<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/orit1.jpg" alt="Orit_Hashay" title="Orit_Hashay" width="333" height="494" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88874" /><strong>Orit Hashay</strong> has also been active in in Israeli startups for over 10 years, having taken on software and business development posts with public companies such as Emblaze and Comverse, as well as consulting for various Israeli startups.</p>
<p>Orit is also somewhat of a local serial entrepreneur. She&#8217;s founded a Yelp-ish review site called <a href="http://www.ramkol.co.il">Ramkol.co.il</a> and <a href="http://www.mit4mit.co.il">mit4mit.co.il</a>, the second most popular wedding review site in Israel. Most recently Orit held the Entrepreneur in Residence role at <a href="http://www.decimaventures.com">Decima Ventures</a>, where she was responsible for technical and market analysis. Decima is also where her newest venture, <a href="http://www.vetrinas.com">Vetrinas</a> was born.</p>
<p>Vetrinas is a virtual shopping window to hundreds of stores from across the fashion Meccas of the world, be it London, New York, Paris or Milan. Vetrinas is targeting three segments: Consumers with an interest in high-fashion. Retailers that want to expose potential on/offline shoppers to specific products or brand advertising. And finally, shop window designers that can display their work (art) in order to attain job offers.</p>
<p>Orit coded all of Vetrina&#8217;s herself and intends to generate revenue by way of affiliation through the site and rev-share through widgets that will syndicate content to blogs and websites. Vetrinas is currently in Alpha. </p>

She took physics, math <em>and</em> political science. Not having gone unnoticed, she went on to become an intelligence officer in the Israeli Defense Forces and then later an Information Systems Engineering graduate of the Technion (Israel&#8217;s MIT).</p>
<p>She then joined eWave where she kept busy with project management and, afterward, marketing, sales and business development. Two years later she joined Israeli dev house Clementina as COO. That&#8217;s where she worked with Israeli startups such as my6sense, Spikko, and Footbo. Temptation was in the air and Gali couldn&#8217;t resist so she recruited a partner and founded <a href="http://www.razoss.com">Razoss</a>.</p>
<p>Gali is still very protective of her product so details and access are limited. In vague terms it can be described as a browser-based content promotion platform, where the idea is to enhance the browser beyond content display, to content management and distribution. </p>
<p>Initial funding was provided by Dr. Yossi Vardi a little over a year ago and a second investment is near closing. The product is in private alpha, with a wider release intended in a few months. </p>

But then the game ends.  Everyone is forced to head back to their normal lives to trudge through their day jobs once more, at least til the next home game comes round.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twolves.png" class="shot2"/>Every day, sports fans congregate at their nearest big-league stadium to bask in each other&#8217;s cheers, body paint, and beer, relishing their shared enthusiasm for the teams they love.  But then the game ends.  Everyone is forced to head back to their normal lives to trudge through their day jobs once more, at least til the next home game comes round.  Social media can offer them some comfort, giving them a chance to take the community home with them.  Unfortunately, many professional sports teams are still failing to tap into this effectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fanchatter.com">FanChatter</a>, a <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded company that&#8217;s launching today, is a startup that&#8217;s looking to help fix this problem.  The company is focused on helping major sports teams increase engagement both during and after games using user-submitted content, Twitter, and other social services.  And while the company is still quite new, it&#8217;s already got some major customers, including the Minnesota Twins, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the University of Oaklahoma. </p>
<p>One of the site&#8217;s core features is its photo gallery.  During games, fans are encouraged to Email photos taken from their cell phones to a designated Email address, for the chance to have their photos appear on the stadium&#8217;s Jumbotron.  Teams receive the photos in real-time and build photo galleries from them, which they can then use in place of the candid video shots we&#8217;ve all seen so many times between innings or during a time-out.  Obviously teams aren&#8217;t able to display <i>every</i> photo submitted, but FanChatter also takes these photos and builds a shared photo album — one for each game — which can then be accessed by fans from the team&#8217;s home page.  You can see what these albums look like by checking out the Twins&#8217; page <a href="http://twins.fanchatter.com/">here</a>.  Fans will also soon be able to share their videos taken at the game, though these likely won&#8217;t be appearing on the Jumbotron as they take too long to filter through.</p>
<p>Another of the company&#8217;s features is the ChatterBox, a widget that can display a stream of tweets relevant to a particular hashtag or topic (the Timberwolves have one that shows tweets with the tag #twolves).  Fans can use this to communicate during the game, and to follow the latest news from home.  The widget is similar to one that&#8217;s offered by <a href="http://www.tinker.com">Tinker</a>, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/30/tinker-gives-twitter-its-long-awaited-events-firehose/">launched</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>FanChatter licenses its technology with fees set on a case-by-case basis, and has plans to extend its technology beyond sports to include other major events, like concerts.  It also has plans to roll out iPhone applications, which would give fans a better way to interact with each other while they&#8217;re still at the game.<br />

By which I mean, I feel like my insides aren't fully developed, I have no strength in my arms or legs and the idea of eating solid food is just a distant dream.

It's all <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/silicon-valley-its-time-to-clean-up/">Lacy's fault</a>, of course, she actually pays for this nonsense every month or so and claims it's the reason why she no longer gets sick when she travels. Arrington and Heather apparently swear by it too.

The rest of TechCrunch, meanwhile, are beyond skeptical, bandying around words like "science" and "proof" in a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that they're in the pay of Big Cheeseburger. Whatever the truth, I've bet Lacy fifty dollars that the only thing the cleanse will achieve for me is crippling hunger and a loss of feeling in my extremities, so I'm in for the duration. At least as I lie on my deathbed, puking water and romaine-and-celery juice into a cardboard bowl, I can comfort myself with the fact that it was free - a promotion by the company to tempt California-based hacks into starving themselves to death. Journalistic freebies for the win (see my statement of ethics: <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/hack-to-the-future-my-long-overdue-statement-of-ethics/">here</a>).

Speaking of ethics, I'm just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as 'Geeks At The Beach', the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don't. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up 'influential' social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it's heading next. In Los Angeles. On a beach.]]></description>

<p>It&#8217;s all <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/silicon-valley-its-time-to-clean-up/">Lacy&#8217;s fault</a>, of course, she actually pays for this nonsense every month or so and claims it&#8217;s the reason why she no longer gets sick when she travels. Arrington and Heather apparently swear by it too.</p>
<p>The rest of TechCrunch, meanwhile, are beyond skeptical, bandying around words like &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;proof&#8221; in a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that they&#8217;re in the pay of Big Cheeseburger. Whatever the truth, I&#8217;ve bet Lacy fifty dollars that the only thing the cleanse will achieve for me is crippling hunger and a loss of feeling in my extremities, so I&#8217;m in for the duration. At least as I lie on my deathbed, puking water and romaine-and-celery juice into a cardboard bowl, I can comfort myself with the fact that it was free - a promotion by the company to tempt California-based hacks into starving themselves to death. Journalistic freebies for the win (see my statement of ethics: <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/hack-to-the-future-my-long-overdue-statement-of-ethics/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of ethics, I&#8217;m just back in San Francisco from an all expenses paid trip to the beach. Promoted as &#8216;Geeks At The Beach&#8217;, the trip came courtesy of J.R. Johnson who runs a new site aiming to bring people together based on things they agree on, to discuss things they don&#8217;t. According to the invitation, J.R. wanted to round up &#8216;influential&#8217; social media types for a day of discussion about trends in the industry, and where it&#8217;s heading next. In Los Angeles. On a beach.</p>
<p>Lacy and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble</a> would be there - so far, so good - but so too would Seaworld-friendly haircaster, <a href="http://julia.nonsociety.com">Julia Allison</a>; LA-based red-carpet dweller, <a href="http://www.ShiraLazar.com">Shira Lazar</a> and various life-casters and me-bloggers whose existence I was only dimly aware of. I hesitated for a moment in accepting: what was supposed to be a meeting of minds could very easily be a train wreck of egos and bikinis and Flipcams and bullshit. Or, to put it another way: the best. column. ever. Count me in.</p>
<p>As it turned out, my worries were only half founded. Yes, there were Flipcams, and lots of egos and bullshit - these were bloggers and life-casters, after all. Yes, at one point the conversation touched a little too closely on whether cupcakes were more or less important than politics in driving community discussions. And yes, certainly, some of those in attendance were clearly more interested in the beach part than the geeks part of the event. But as the day went on, a hardcore group of us - including but certainly not limited to me, Scoble, Lacy and J.R. - really did get down to some proper, substantive debate over two issues that occupy almost every day of our lives. The first was Internet anonymity - my thoughts on which you <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/25/nsfw-bringing-nothing-to-techcrunch-and-a-brand-new-reality-to-the-unter-trolls">enjoyed last week</a> - and the second was the future of journalism, and how life-casting and unpaid blogging most certainly isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a horribly pompous misconception amongst bloggers that they are somehow &#8216;taking on the mainstream media&#8217;. &#8220;Those old losers just don&#8217;t get it!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;We bloggers are on the scene first, asking tough questions before the mainstream media have even put their shoes on&#8221;. Indeed, as uber-blogger Scoble pointed out, taking another sip from his glass of free sake, there were no AP photographers on the plane that went down in the Hudson.</p>
<p>When it comes to a certain type of highly visible breaking news, no-one can argue that social media kicks the mainstream media&#8217;s ass. At any given disaster, there&#8217;s possibly a 0.01% chance that a professional journalist or photographer will already be on the scene, compared to 100% odds that there&#8217;ll be some dude with a camera-phone there. And as for asking tough questions: yep, bloggers are pretty good at that too - hardly a syllable can slip from the mouth of a politician or public official without it being torn apart by an army of &#8216;fact-checking&#8217; bloggers, hungry for content. </p>
<p>And yet, I argued back, after camera phone dude helps us establish that the plane has crashed, who can we trust to tell us <em>why</em> it happened? While bloggers can own the first five minutes of any breaking story - a plane crash, a fire, a burglary - it&#8217;s always going to be the professional reporters who own the next five days, or five weeks. They walk the streets, work their contacts and - yes -  trawl the blogosphere for eye-witness reports, and then take all of that information, analyse it, follow it up and ultimately provide an account of events that readers can trust.</p>
<p>Or at least this is what they used to do. If that were still how journalism works then the unpaid bloggers wouldn&#8217;t have a hope of competing. But unfortunately, thanks to a succession of journalistic fakes and the constant tabloidisation of the press, that trust is gone. Why should someone - either an advertiser or a reader - be prepared to pay for a newspaper when they can get the same old lies and fluff from the blogosphere?</p>
<p>As we sat in Los Angeles, debating how to save what remains of professional journalism, Michael Arrington was posting one possible solution on this very blog. In a post titled &#8216;<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/what-if-the-new-new-york-times">What If: The New New York Times</a>&#8216; he argued that the New York Times should lay off all but 50 of its reporters, leaving behind the crack team of superstar hacks who truly drive the paper&#8217;s value. These cuts, he said, would allow the remaining reporters to be paid a generous wage for their work, thus solving the twin questions of trust and of how to pay for good journalism in future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice idea, but one that overlooks the fact that a superstar hack takes days - or weeks - of legwork to get to the bottom of a single story. Without content from workaday photographers or wire-feed-re-writers, the New New York Times would be three pages long and published weekly. Good journalism is a slow, labour-intensive business. And what about unglamourous local stories? Let&#8217;s not forget that the two most famous reporters of all time - Woodward and Bernstein - were junior reporters when the broke their most famous story: Watergate. A story, let&#8217;s also not forget, that began life as a dull local burglary. Which of the 50 top flight hacks would have been assigned to that?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t matter how you twist it, there&#8217;s simply no way for the New York Times to regain its position as the news reporter of record in the Internet era. Instead, if Mike really wants to save the Times, while simultaneously seeing the future of journalism, he should look a little closer to home. </p>
<p>To TechCrunch in fact. </p>
<p>Because while TechCrunch might be &#8216;just&#8217; a blog it&#8217;s also, as I&#8217;ve discovered in the past few weeks, a hell of a professional journalistic machine. Whatever the cynics might think, it&#8217;s a place where sources are built up, facts are checked, lawyers are employed and writers are encouraged to go out and get the real story behind the story. It&#8217;s also on something of a hiring spree at the moment - looking out at traditional media and cherry picking those (ahem) who it thinks can bring more value to the brand. In doing so, TechCrunch is one of a handful of tech blogs that commands solid advertising revenues and has - by and large - build up huge trust amongst readers. Trust which allows it to host events like TechCrunch 50, bringing in even more money to support the site&#8217;s journalism.</p>
<p>Right across the Internet there are countless other sites that employ the same standards for other niches - from music (<a href="http://www.pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a>) to politics (<a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a>) to farming (I have no idea) - each of which can afford to dedicate more time to their very specific field of expertise than the New York Times could, even if it doubled its staff.</p>
<p>And so if I were the New York Times, I&#8217;d realise that in the face of such solid niche competition, my days as a news-gatherer were over. I&#8217;d lay off all of my journalists, shut down the presses (a move favoured by Lacy during a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jul/08/journalism-internet-socialmedia-businessmodels">recent Guardian podcast</a>), close the doors and thank God for giving me such a good innings. Then the next day I&#8217;d round up maybe 20 or 30 of my best editors and I&#8217;d launch a brand new site. A site which, like a far more mainstream <a href="http://www.aldaily.com/">Arts and Letters Daily</a>, would use those skilled human editors to aggregate the best specialist reporting from around the web into one all-encompassing news source.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d link to posts on TechCrunch, and Pitchfork and FiveThirtyEight and on any other site that my professional editors had determined was providing the best coverage of each of the days most important stories. And I&#8217;d work hard - really hard - to rebuild my brand credibility so that readers knew that they could absolutely trust the reporting on any site that had been selected by editors. All the news that&#8217;s fit to link.</p>
<p>For the New York Times, the cost in doing all of this would be limited to retaining the 30 best editors in the business, and the small support staff required to keep them productive - costs easily covered thanks to the millions of eyeballs that would visit just such a site every day, hungry for news sources they can actually trust.</p>
<p>For the specialist sites being linked to, the boost in traffic and credibility would only bring more targeted advertising revenue and more possibilities for spin off events, books and the rest, all of which contribute to the journalistic bottom line and their ability to hire from the army of recently unemployed journalists.</p>
<p>And as for the life-casters and amateur bloggers - they can keep having their fun too; contributing user generated content to the niche sites, and then re-parsing the coverage on their own blogs, Twitter stream or - in Scoble&#8217;s case - FriendFeed. It&#8217;s a solution where every one&#8217;s a winner. Except for the life casters, who by and large will remain losers.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no reason the aggregating site has to be created by the New York Times; anyone with some high-level editorial experience could do it. Equally there&#8217;s no reason why there can&#8217;t be dozens of these aggregators, each with their own editorial voice: one for liberals, one for conservatives, one for wealthy Brits, one for college kids in Guatemala. The point is that the days of the profitable generalist news-gatherer are dying, but the days of solid reporting and a strong, trusted editorial voice must never be allowed to perish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a point that&#8217;s so important it kept a group of us arguing until the early hours in Los Angeles, and so important that the possible solution has been bouncing around my head ever since. Hell, it&#8217;s so important that I feel like getting up from my desk right now and hitting the streets looking for the perfect newsman-turned-entrepreneur to make it happen.</p>
<p>If only I wasn&#8217;t on this stupid juice cleanse and hadn&#8217;t lost the use of my legs.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88809" title="picture-32" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-32.png" alt="picture-32" width="328" height="452" />The existence of Apple&#8217;s new so-called &#8220;Cocktail&#8221; music experience being created with the major record labels seemed to create headlines last week more for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/are-apple-and-the-music-labels-mixing-holiday-cocktails-on-the-tablet/">side-talk about the Apple tablet</a>, than the music element itself. And for good reason, because just as we wrote last week, it&#8217;s starting to sound like this is mainly another ploy to pull more money out of consumers&#8217; pockets.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, it&#8217;s also starting to sound like the music industry may be taking a cue from the rise of mobile applications, to position this new format.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE5701KE20090801">Reuters has a new report</a> today about the Cocktail plan. After you wade through the usual PR speak from music execs about how this will change the digital music experience for consumers, you get to the real nugget of information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will the Cocktail format drive greater digital album sales? Probably not, but that&#8217;s not what the music industry is expecting from it. Instead, label sources position it as a way to further monetize existing digital album purchases. While pricing information isn&#8217;t available, Cocktail-formatted albums will almost certainly cost more than the standard album available on iTunes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there something to be said for the missing experience of opening a record or CD for the first time, and checking out things like the artwork? Of course. But if the industry execs really cared about that, they&#8217;d come up with a standard to offer that without jacking up prices on consumers to give them a better experience.</p>
<p>Instead, they have likely come up with a way to charge more for content, while wrapping it in some new marketing. And while the execs and most outlets are mostly pushing the Apple angle specifically, the idea is to get these new types of digital albums to all the big digital music outlets, as Greg Sandoval <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10296045-93.html">reported last week</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s smart to push Apple&#8217;s role in this because it sounds like it is doing things a little differently than what the music labels plan to do with the rest of the outlets. And it seems like a good bet that Apple&#8217;s version could offer a better experience than the others. The reason is that Apple&#8217;s digital content is so tightly integrated with its devices. So something like Cocktail on an iPhone or iPod touch could be a lot nicer than simply trying to run it on a computer or a less capable mobile media player.</p>
<p>And from what&#8217;s being said about all of this, it&#8217;s starting to sound like these Cocktails may actually be album apps of sorts, that you open and interact with while listening to the music. Again, Apple has already proven itself in the app game.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this new format takes off in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, but don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking that the prime motivation for this is anything but a way for the labels to make more money.</p>

Right about now, Apple probably wishes it had never <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected Google Voice</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">related apps</a> from the iPhone.  Or maybe it was AT&#038;T who rejected the apps.  Nobody really knows.  But the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an investigation</a> last night to find out, sending letters to all three companies (Apple, AT&#038;T, and Google) asking them to explain exactly what happened.

On its face, it might seem odd to some people that the FCC is investigating the rejection of a single iPhone app.  After all, iPhone apps are rejected every day.  But the Google Voice rejection caused an unusual amount of <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090727/p90#a090727p90">uproar</a>, and there is nothing like a high-profile case to make an example out of in pursuit of pushing a bigger policy agenda.  The FCC investigation is not just about the arbitrary rejection of a single app.  It is the FCC's way of putting a stake in the ground for making the wireless networks controlled by cell phone carriers as open as the Internet.]]></description>

<p>Right about now, Apple probably wishes it had never <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">rejected Google Voice</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-yanks-the-cord-on-gv-mobile-is-it-trying-to-kill-google-voice-on-the-iphone/">related apps</a> from the iPhone.

But the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/">FCC launched an investigation</a> last night to find out, sending letters to all three companies (Apple, AT&#038;T, and Google) asking them to explain exactly what happened.</p>
<p>On its face, it might seem odd to some people that the FCC is investigating the rejection of a single iPhone app.  After all, iPhone apps are rejected every day.  But the Google Voice rejection caused an unusual amount of <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090727/p90#a090727p90">uproar</a>, and there is nothing like a high-profile case to make an example out of in pursuit of pushing a bigger policy agenda.  The FCC investigation is not just about the arbitrary rejection of a single app.  It is the FCC&#8217;s way of putting a stake in the ground for making the wireless networks controlled by cell phone carriers as open as the Internet.</p>
<p>Today there are two different sets of rules for applications and devices on the Internet.  On the wired Internet, we can connect any type of PC or other computing device and use any applications we want on those devices.  On the wireless Internet controlled by cellular carriers like AT&#038;T, we can only use the phones they allow on their networks and can only use the applications they approve.  This was fine when the wireless networks were used mostly just for voice calls.  But now that they are increasingly becoming our mobile connections to the Internet and mobile phones are becoming full-fledged mobile computers, an argument has been growing that the same rules of open access that rule the wired Internet should apply to the wireless Internet.</p>
<p>While Apple and AT&#038;T cannot be too happy about the FCC investigation, Google must secretly be pleased as punch.  It was only two years ago, prior to the 700MHz wireless spectrum auctions, that it was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/">pleading with the FCC</a> to adopt principles guaranteeing open access for applications, devices, services, and other networks. Now two years later, in a different context and under a different administration, the FCC is pushing for the same principles.</p>
<p>In its letters requesting more information from all three companies, the FCC cites &#8220;pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access (RM-11361) and handset exclusivity (RM-11497).  That first proceeding on open access dates back to 2007 when <a href=" http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/02/22/skype-begs-fcc-to-open-cell-networks/">Skype requested</a> that cell phone carriers open up their networks to all applications (see <a href=" http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:WMsHzJyFR6IJ:www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/pisc-skype-comments-20070430.pdf+RM-11361&#038;cd=2&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=us&#038;client=firefox-a">Skype&#8217;s petition here</a>).  Like Google Voice, Skype helps consumers bypass the carriers.  The carriers don&#8217;t like that because it erodes their core business and turns them into dumb pipes.</p>
<p>But dumb pipes are what we need.  They are good for consumers and good for competition because they allow any application and any device, within reason, to flower on the wireless Internet.  So if you look at the questions the FCC is asking, it wants to know why the Google Voice app was rejected and whether AT&#038;T (the carrier) had anything to do with that rejection:</p>
<blockquote><p>2. Did Apple act alone, or in consultation with AT&#038;T, in deciding to reject the Google Voice application and related applications? . . . </p>
<p>3. Does AT&#038;T have any role in the approval of iPhone applications generally (or in certain cases)?  If so, under what circumstances, and what role does it play? </p></blockquote>
<p>The FCC also wants Apple to explain the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/lets-stop-picking-on-those-iphone-app-reviewers-actually-lets-not/">arbitrariness</a> of its app approval process:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Please explain any differences between the Google Voice iPhone application and any Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications that Apple has approved for the iPhone.  Are any of the approved VoIP applications allowed to operate on AT&#038;T’s 3G network?</p>
<p>5. What other applications have been rejected for use on the iPhone and for what reasons?  Is there a list of prohibited applications or of categories of applications that is provided to potential vendors/developers?  If so, is this posted on the iTunes website or otherwise disclosed to consumers?</p>
<p>6. What are the standards for considering and approving iPhone applications?   What is the approval process for such applications (timing, reasons for rejection, appeal process, etc.)?  What is the percentage of applications that are rejected?  What are the major reasons for rejecting an application?</p></blockquote>
<p>Good questions.  Hopefully, the FCC will share Apple&#8217;s answers with the rest of the us.  It is all a bit absurd, though.  Why does it take a formal request from a government agency to get Apple (and AT&#038;T) to explain what the rules are to get on the wireless Internet?  More importantly, why are these companies allowed to be the gatekeepers to the wireless Internet?   The iPhone needs to be smashed open, and the FCC is swinging the hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AT&#038;T responded to this post with the following statements:</p>
<blockquote><p>
AT&#038;T does not manage or approve applications for the App Store. We have received the letter and will, of course, respond to it.</p>
<p>Customers can use any compatible GSM phone on our network, not just the ones we’ve approved and sell.  And they also can use apps we don’t approve.  We don’t approve iPhone applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. You can use any mobile app you like on AT&#038;T—unless it is an iPhone app (that&#8217;s been rejected by Apple).  Does Apple ever reject apps at the request of AT&#038;T though?  Maybe they&#8217;ll give the FCC a straight answer.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr-215x141.jpg" width="215" height="141" />Ever since I've started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I've been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it's not getting any better. 

It's not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.

When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given 'best practice' and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible. Regular TechCrunch readers know <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/04/the-reality-of-pr-smile-dial-name-drop-pray/">how we think about the PR industry</a> - and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/lois-whitman-now-an-unwilling-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-pr/">some of its proponents</a> - in today's world, and in particular <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/">our stance towards embargoes</a>.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pr.jpg" class="shot2" />Ever since I&#8217;ve started blogging about technology a couple of years ago, I&#8217;ve been consistently growing an immense feeling of hate towards press releases, and it&#8217;s not getting any better. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I dislike the PR industry in general, although I often wonder how so many of these firms continue to be in business when the large majority of them have been doing it exactly the same way for the past few decades, instead of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/11/the-evolution-of-the-press-release/">evolving</a>.</p>
<p>When media distribution and usage was less fragmented than it is now, I guess it made sense for PR firms or consultants to write press releases using a given &#8216;best practice&#8217; and pushing it out to a list of contacts in the publishing industry, hoping for as much coverage as possible. Regular TechCrunch readers know <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/04/the-reality-of-pr-smile-dial-name-drop-pray/">how we think about the PR industry</a> - and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/lois-whitman-now-an-unwilling-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-pr/">some of its proponents</a> - in today&#8217;s world, and in particular <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/">our stance towards embargoes</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle a different problem in this post, one that reporters from around the world, whatever field they cover, will no doubt recognize. The issue I have with press releases, and the reason I think they are a thing of the distant past in their current form, is that they basically all look alike. Sure, the companies that are talked about can be different, and the type of news coming from them can be different, but the copy, form and style are often so much alike that for large parts of the announcements you could just as easily swap the names of the companies and keep the rest of the words. Oftentimes, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with press releases is that for basically as long as they&#8217;ve been around, they&#8217;ve contained the same damn words, rendering them completely meaningless in most cases and contexts. I wonder what the world would be like if these words were henceforth permanently banned from all press releases:</p>
<p><strong>1 ) LEADING / LEADER</strong></p>
<p>You know the kind: <em>&#8220;Initech, the leading blah in blah blah blah, has partnered with Initrode, leader in blah blah blahblah blah blah blah.&#8221;</em> Every single time a press release carries either one of these words in the first sentence, I cringe. Why? Because if everyone is leading, no one is. Period. PR people, next time you start writing a news announcement, ask yourself if you really should be using the words &#8216;leading&#8217; or &#8216;leader&#8217; just because it&#8217;s easy and everyone is doing it.</p>
<p><strong>2 ) BEST / MOST / FASTEST / LARGEST / BIGGEST / etc.</strong></p>
<p>Emphasizing the strengths of the company you&#8217;re pitching is obviously a good thing. But does anyone realize how meaningless these terms become when they are followed up by something so blatantly untrue or tied to a small niche that it&#8217;s just painful to read? I&#8217;m specifically thinking about press releases that commence with something like <em>&#8220;Initech, the largest manufacturer of red staplers engraved with our company logo, has just won the Buzo Award for the most uncreative use of the word &#8216;largest&#8217; in the history of mankind.&#8221;</em> Handle these words with care.</p>
<p><strong>3 ) INNOVATIVE / INNOVATION</strong></p>
<p>The mother of all voidness. How many truly innovative products are launched on a yearly basis, regardless of the sector? How many times have you seen something get the &#8216;innovation&#8217; label without merit? Unless you or your clients find a cure for all cancers, simply stop using it, starting today. Now that would be innovative.</p>
<p><strong>4 ) REVOLUTIONARY</strong></p>
<p>Much like the above, terrible word to be using in press releases. What exactly about your product is going to make people leave their houses to demonstrate, oppose their government, riot, etc.? Oh, sorry, you mean the company you&#8217;re pitching is not going to change the world but it is going to completely change the way an industry thinks about your business? Safe bet: it&#8217;s not going to. Likely you&#8217;re just doing the old &#8216;wishful thinking&#8217; routine, and everyone knows you are.</p>
<p><strong>5 ) AWARD-WINNING</strong></p>
<p>Trust me, telling anyone willing to listen that you&#8217;ve been recognized with this or that award won&#8217;t be providing you with any goodwill right off the bat. There are exceptions to this rule, but very few (they include the Nobel Prize, a Pulitzer, a <a href="http://crunchies2008.techcrunch.com/">Crunchie</a> or a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/announcing-the-europas-the-techcrunch-europe-awards-2009/">Europa Award</a>). Basically it&#8217;s like going around a party informing everyone that you&#8217;ve had sex with a human being last week: I&#8217;m sure it matters to you a great deal - and hopefully to the other person as well - but the rest of us likely don&#8217;t give a hoot. We also think it&#8217;s kind of sad that you are looking for someone to confirm or recognize your accomplishments that way. A tip: unless you&#8217;re announcing that you&#8217;ve actually won an award (which by the way is only very rarely newsworthy), leave it out.</p>
<p><strong>6 ) DISRUPTIVE / DISRUPTION</strong></p>
<p>Newsflash: a product or service is only very, very, very rarely disruptive. If there is a truly ground-breaking one, it&#8217;s also never disruptive out of the gate, for it can take years or even decades to turn an entire industry upside down. The fact that you&#8217;d use the word in a press release speaks volumes about your ability to tell your head from your ass: anything truly disruptive doesn&#8217;t happen overnight, and you can&#8217;t capture &#8216;disruption&#8217; in a news announcement pushed out at a given time and date. Besides, if something is genuinely disruptive I&#8217;m sure it will require little push from PR people or firms to get the word out there.</p>
<p><strong>7 ) CUTTING / BLEEDING EDGE</strong></p>
<p>In the same boat as the words &#8216;innovative&#8217;, &#8216;revolutionary&#8217; and &#8216;disruptive&#8217;: so often misused in the past that it now looks like you&#8217;re practicing your skills to write quality satire when you use it to tout a company or product in a press release. </p>
<p><strong>8 ) NEXT-GENERATION</strong></p>
<p>Overused. If you have an updated version of your product to announce, why not just say so? I simply cannot understand what people are trying to tell me when they say their new release is &#8216;next-gen&#8217;. Is it too advanced or complex for me to use and will only young children have the ability to understand what you&#8217;re doing when they grow up? Did your previous product version stink so bad that you needed to skip an entire generation of iterations to finally get it right?</p>
<p><strong>9 ) STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>Partnering with other companies can be good - and newsworthy too, though not often - but it doesn&#8217;t help you get more attention or goodwill when you announce a <em>strategic</em> partnership, agreement or relationship. We&#8217;re assuming it fits in both your strategy and the one of the company or companies you team up with, otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t be forming an alliance, right? It&#8217;s not like your agreement suddenly gets a whole other dimension because it&#8217;s labeled &#8217;strategic&#8217;, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>10 ) SYNERGY</strong></p>
<p>Simply defined, synergy means that the whole in combination is greater than the sum of the individual parts working on their own. Used properly, the word can describe the magnified effects of two drugs taken together, parasites that enforce each other’s destructive effects and compounded health risks due to toxic chemicals. When applied to corporations, it means a financial benefit that a company aims to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation. As history teaches us, there’s rarely any synergy involved when companies melt together or one takes over the other (cough, AOL-Time Warner).

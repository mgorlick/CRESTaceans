The application is free and you can grab it <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=325982525&#038;mt=8">here</a>.  

Center'd competes with sites like <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://www.citysearch.com">CitySearch</a>, but instead of simply offering text reviews, the service scours the web for reviews and descriptions and performs semantic analysis on them, allowing you to perform more detailed searches than you could on other sites.

In my testing I found the app's manual search mode, which lets you search by keywords, to be pretty hit-or-miss.  During one search for "large portions" Center'd pulled up a list of matching restaurants, but the app didn't do a good job explaining <i>why</i> it thought they had large portions (you'd expect it to display any relevant text in its database, but it didn't).]]></description>

<p>Center&#8217;d competes with sites like <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://www.citysearch.com">CitySearch</a>, but instead of simply offering text reviews, the service scours the web for reviews and descriptions and performs semantic analysis on them, allowing you to perform more detailed searches than you could on other sites.</p>
<p>In my testing I found the app&#8217;s manual search mode, which lets you search by keywords, to be pretty hit-or-miss.  During one search for &#8220;large portions&#8221; Center&#8217;d pulled up a list of matching restaurants, but the app didn&#8217;t do a good job explaining <i>why</i> it thought they had large portions (you&#8217;d expect it to display any relevant text in its database, but it didn&#8217;t).  In fact, when I looked through the details of the top hit for &#8220;large portions&#8221;, that restaurant&#8217;s top keyword was &#8220;small plates&#8221;.  Go figure.</p>
<p>Search leaves something to be desired, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the app isn&#8217;t worth checking out. Its City Guides functionality, which lets you search using a number of pre-set filters, is actually quite helpful.  To use it, you first choose a description of what you&#8217;re looking for (options include things like &#8216;Kid-friendly&#8217;, &#8216;Romantic&#8217;, and &#8216;Outdoors&#8217;).  Then you choose the type of venue you&#8217;re looking for, be it a restaurant, event, shopping or attraction.  The app pulls up a list of matches, and for the most part I found these to be pretty accurate — a search for kid-friendly restaurants in Palo Alto pulled up local favorite &#8216;The Creamery&#8217; as the top result, and the app also made it easy to pull up a list of local bars with outdoor patios.</p>
<p>Aside from the iPhone app, Center&#8217;d is seeing strong growth, though its traffic is still pretty modest.  Since April the service has doubled its traffic.</p>

<p>Also worth checking out is Yelp&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/yelp-iphone-v3-hits-the-appstore-find-local-deals/">new iPhone application</a>, which includes deals from local merchants.</p>

Translated into this Twitter world we now live in, that&#8217;s like, thousands of characters. Thousands easily beats 140, so the people constantly complaining about Twitter&#8217;s brevity need to check out <a href="http://dailybooth.com">DailyBooth</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? It&#8217;s a Twitter-like quick message service, only the main form of communication is pictures. You can send pictures of anything you want, though most users tend to send images of themselves, photo booth-style, and attach messages to them. The result is a crazy amount of interaction in the community. And interestingly enough, <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/teens-dont-tweet-twitters-growth-not-fueled-by-youth/">unlike Twitter</a>, it seems to be a hotbed for teenage activity.</p>
<p>While there have been no shortage of startups that have launched picture services for Twitter, the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>-backed DailyBooth is a little different in that it tries to stand on its own by emphasizing its own social stream (though there is Twitter tie-in as well). In that regard it&#8217;s more like <a href="http://radar.net/">Radar</a> than TwitPic or some of the other standard Twitter photo services. But Radar places an emphasis on cameraphone pictures, as I said, DailyBooth seems to be populated more by photos of people taking pictures of themselves, sitting at their computers. Though you can upload pictures from a mobile device as well.</p>
<p>And DailyBooth&#8217;s growth has been pretty amazing. As you can see in the chart below, since its launch in January, DailyBooth has grown to over 3 million unique visitors a month. And they have a growth rate now of about 35% a month, which means they should easily hit 4 million uniques this month, founder Jon Wheatley tells us.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-93111" style="border: 1px solid gray" title="11" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/11-630x515.png" alt="11" width="630" height="515" /></p>
<p>One reason for this growth has to be the active community. I uploaded one picture last night around 2 AM, just my standard profile icon, and it almost immediately got 8 comments even though no one was explicitly following me. This morning, my inbox was bombarded by notifications from DailyBooth, new pictures notifications, new follower notifications, recent activity on my pictures, etc. Sure, that was a little annoying (you can change the email alerts in your settings), but also nice to see such a new community with that kind of activity.</p>
<p>Y Combinator&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-graham">Paul Graham</a> says that at one point they had considered a name change for DailyBooth, but then realized just how engaged the community already was with the service (the picture at the top is just one example), and that a name change may have caused a revolt.</p>
<p>The service recently added a bunch of new features including the ability to send DailyBooth images to many of the major social networks. And you can automatically set your latest DailyBooth picture to be your MySpace or Facebook profile picture.</p>
<p>I often find myself clicking on pictures posted to Twitter even if I don&#8217;t really know the person. And one of the main features I&#8217;ve liked of <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> and now newer services like <a href="http://brizzly.com">Brizzly</a> is that they put pictures sent to Twitter inline, so you don&#8217;t have to click anywhere to see them. DailyBooth takes that one step farther and makes it all about the pictures. And it does so in a simpler and more social atmosphere than a site like Flickr. The results seem to speak for themselves in their growth.</p>

You want the redirect to be fast and reliable.

<p>Pingdom tested two things: the average time it took each service to load a page (overhead) and its uptime.  The fastest service was actually <a href="http://is.gd/">Is.gd</a> (with an average load time of 163 milliseconds), followed by bit.ly (261 milliseconds) and ow.ly (289 milliseconds).</p>
<p>Tr.im was the third slowest after <a href="http://cli.gs/">Cli.gs</a> and <a href="http://snipurl.com/">Snip.url</a>.  But when it comes to reliability, Tr.im had nearly twice the estimated yearly downtime as the next worse service (<a href="http://twurl.cc/">Twurl</a>).  Even with nearly 80 hours of estimated annual downtime, Tr.im still had 99.10 percent reliability.  Ow.ly, however, had 100% uptime, and bit.ly came in second with 99.98 percent.  (Is.gd came in fifth).</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/url-reliability.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When both the reliability and speed rankings are combined, ow.ly and bit.ly tie for first place overall, followed by Is.gd and <a href="http://su.pr/">Su.pr</a>.  Here is the complete ranking (the scores are the rankings for each test added together):</p>

Personal finance tracking site <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a> added a bunch of new budgeting and trending features today.  Mint presents consumers with a financial dashboard based on spending and income data from their bank, credit card, and other financial accounts.  It expanded its charts to include spending over time, income history, asset allocation, and net worth over time.  

You can now plan for irregular expenses such as property taxes, auto insurance, or vacations.  Budgeted items can be rolled over into the next month if they haven't been used up, and Mint now figures out your income based on your paycheck.  It takes all of this data and projects your savings or shortfall over time.

All of these new features will be appreciated by Mint's 1.4 million registered (and 550,000 active) users, but they also point to a new direction for the site: bookkeeping for small businesses. ]]></description>

<p>Personal finance tracking site <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a> added a bunch of new budgeting and trending features today.  Mint presents consumers with a financial dashboard based on spending and income data from their bank, credit card, and other financial accounts.  It expanded its charts to include spending over time, income history, asset allocation, and net worth over time.  </p>
<p>You can now plan for irregular expenses such as property taxes, auto insurance, or vacations.  Budgeted items can be rolled over into the next month if they haven&#8217;t been used up, and Mint now figures out your income based on your paycheck.  It takes all of this data and projects your savings or shortfall over time.</p>
<p>All of these new features will be appreciated by Mint&#8217;s 1.4 million registered (and 550,000 active) users, but they also point to a new direction for the site: bookkeeping for small businesses.  Mint now has pretty robust reporting for personal expenses, income, and savings.  These same tools could very easily be tweaked to help small businesses track costs, revenues, and profits.  </p>
<p>All Mint needs to do is change the names of the categories, and add an invoicing feature to go after basic accounting sites like <a href=" http://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> or <a href="http://outright.com/">Outright</a>, which are in turn going after Intuit&#8217;s more fully-featured <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/">QuickBooks</a>.  </p>
<p>For entrepreneurs with limited time on their hands, the ability to track both personal and business finances in one place would have obvious appeal.</p>

Check out their review for more details, but here's the gist:

- A new home screen (see first screenshot above) which will offer the ability to customize i.e. add boxes to the default start screen

- A better 'News feed': much more complete overview of status updates from your friends, but still lacking the ability to hide/unhide them from inside the app

- Videos (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">as expected</a>): uploading video supposedly works like a charm, but you still can't watch Facebook videos unless they're actually hosted on YouTube (and likely other video hosting platforms as well) and simply played from inside the app

- Events (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/details-on-the-upcoming-new-facebook-iphone-app-now-with-events/">as expected</a>): includes the ability to RSVP, but you can't visit the complete event wall, which is unfortunate

<p>Check out their review for more details, but here&#8217;s the gist:</p>
<p>- A new home screen (see first screenshot above) which will offer the ability to customize i.e. add boxes to the default start screen</p>
<p>- A better &#8216;News feed&#8217;: much more complete overview of status updates from your friends, but still lacking the ability to hide/unhide them from inside the app</p>
<p>- Videos (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/">as expected</a>): uploading video supposedly works like a charm, but you still can&#8217;t watch Facebook videos unless they&#8217;re actually hosted on YouTube (and likely other video hosting platforms as well) and simply played from inside the app</p>

<p>- Pages: you can search for, view and interact with pages using Facebook for iPhone 3.0</p>
<p>- Photos: you can create new photo albums, upload photos to any album, zoom into photos and change your profile picture</p>
<p>- Communication: you can quickly or call people straight from the Friends page</p>
<p>- Improved &#8216;liking&#8217; feature</p>
<p>- Notes, including the ability to edit them</p>
<p>- Notifications: much better, link directly to comments which you can respond to</p>
<p>- Messages you are typing will be restored if you quit the app or are interrupted by a phone call</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping for a quick green light from Apple.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> also got confirmation that there&#8217;s no landscape mode in this version.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> a lot more screenshots are available <a href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/facebook-3-0-iphone-nouveaux-screenshots-details-23120/">here</a>.</p>

In addition to video clips, the app also boasts a collection of quizzes, photo galleries, programming schedules and updates from Discovery News. Furthermore, you can use the app to share content via e-mail and save to favorites for your re-watching pleasure.

Evidently, full episodes for Discovery's top programming (Shark Week, Man vs. Wild, MythBusters, etc.) are not available through the free yet ad-supported application, but it does come with links to the iTunes Store where the media company offers a selection of full episodes for purchase.]]></description>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/qwest.jpg" class="shot2" />Over and out for the MVNO model? </p>
<p><a href="http://qwest.com/">Qwest</a> has this morning <a href="http://news.qwest.com/QwestWirelessTransition">announced</a> that it will be shutting down its Wireless service on Oct. 31, 2009. Formerly <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/05/06/qwest-dumps-sprint-in-favor-of-verizon-for-cell-service/">in bed with Sprint</a>, Qwest started offering the wireless service <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/07/30/qwest-begins-offering-verizon-wireless-services/">in collaboration with Verizon</a> just over a year ago. Under the agreement, Verizon Wireless phones and services were offered to Qwest&#8217;s residential and business customers.</p>
<p>Qwest customers who switch to a new service provider within the 60-day period will be able to transfer their wireless phone numbers to their new provider of choice, and there is no early termination fee when disconnecting from Qwest Wireless. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://news.qwest.com/file.php/424/QwestWirelessTransitionFacts08.17.09.pdf">fact sheet</a> (PDF), Qwest started transitioning Qwest Wireless customers to Verizon<br />
Wireless in August 2008 and has since switched &#8220;tens of thousands of customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>More information is available <a href="http://news.qwest.com/QwestWirelessTransition">here</a>.</p>

His Facebook campaign page is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/chriskelly">here</a>.

Today, apparently, is Kelly's 39th birthday. I know this because I was forwarded an email from his wife Jennifer asking recipients to donate to Kelly's campaign. 

I don't agree with some of Kelly's positions (he was on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/jew-haters-welcome-at-facebook-as-long-as-they-arent-lactating/">wrong side</a> of Facebook's Holocaust denial debacle, in my opinion), but I'm contemplating endorsing him for the position pending his agreement to go on camera with us and answer some key questions we and our readers have.

His Facebook campaign page is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/chriskelly">here</a>.</p>
<p>Today, apparently, is Kelly&#8217;s 39th birthday. I know this because I was forwarded an email from his wife Jennifer asking recipients to donate to Kelly&#8217;s campaign. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with some of Kelly&#8217;s positions (he was on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/10/jew-haters-welcome-at-facebook-as-long-as-they-arent-lactating/">wrong side</a> of Facebook&#8217;s Holocaust denial debacle, in my opinion), but I&#8217;m contemplating endorsing him for the position pending his agreement to go on camera with us and answer some key questions we and our readers have. </p>
<p>Generally though Kelly is a libertarian-leaning Democrat, which is kind of Democrat I tend to like. If you want to donate to his campaign, <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/chriskelly?refcode=techcrunch">here&#8217;s the link</a>. </p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re feeling generous, you can get Chris something else for his birthday, too.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/typepad-microblog.png" />Microblogging is one popular type of cake, and <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> damn well <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/microblog.html">wants a piece of it</a> too. The company has just added a new element to its <a href="http://typepad.com">TypePad</a> offering: a so-called <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-best-of-both-worlds-microblogging-on-typepad.html">&#8216;microblog-style blog&#8217;</a>, which I imagine could just as well simply be dubbed a microblog. If you know what <a href="http://posterous.com">Posterous</a> is and does, it&#8217;s easy to explain what the new TypePad feature does: exactly the same. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a TypePad user, you can now post by e-mailing in an article or using your iPhone to publish whatever short posts, links, videos and pictures you want to put up on the web easily and rapidly. And you can just as easily push the content back out to other services such as Facebook, Twitter and FriendFeed while you&#8217;re at it, which is entirely in line with what Posterous has been all about since its inception. To complement the new feature, Six Apart is also adding some new custom themes to TypePad, starting with the <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/new-microblogging-theme.html">Pico template</a> the company introduced yesterday.</p>
<p>The only difference with Posterous that I can see is the support and training Six Apart provides with its TypePad service and the fact that you can add advertising units to your new mini-blog, although I can&#8217;t imagine this will convince many individuals to actually <a href="http://www.typepad.com/pricing/">pay</a> for a microblogging service when there are so many free alternatives.</p>
<p>Or will it?</p>

<p>The ads are little contextual text ads at the bottom of the image.  They are not horrible, but they aren&#8217;t beautiful either.  Attaching ads to stock photos is a good idea, but these companies still need to work on presentation. Maybe that is where a developer using the API can help.</p>

<p>Jambool initially started off as a developer for games on social networks — a lucrative but very crowded space that includes players like <a href="http://www.zynga.com">Zynga</a> and <a href="http://www.playfish.com">Playfish</a>.  In fall 2008, the company decided to <a href="http://www.virtualgoodsnews.com/2009/02/why-jambool-focused-on-payments-with-social-gold.html">switch</a> its focus from game building to providing a platform that other developers can use to quickly integrate microtransactions.  That suite of products, collectively referred to as Social Gold, now includes an an in-game payment system that includes support for credits cards, mobile payments, and online transaction systems like PayPal and Google Checkout; a virtual currency system; and a set of analytics tools for developers to track their in-game economy and performance.  Going forward the site plans to offer a subscription product in the new future, as well as more self-serve options for developers.</p>
<p>There are a number of other startups looking to help monetize the social web with micropayments, which include <a href="http://getgambit.com/">Gambit</a> and <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/">OfferPal</a>.  These companies also have to worry about social networks launching their own payment platforms (Facebook has one that has been in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/11/facebook-payment-platform-to-enter-testing-soon-only-7-months-late/">testing</a> for a few months), though companies like Jambool have the advantage of being able to offer a &#8216;universal currency&#8217; that works across multiple social networks.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kitchsink-173x200.png" width="173" height="200" />A new lawsuit filed against Facebook in the Superior Court of California in Orange County is one of the more entertaining documents we've had the pleasure of reading recently. A lot of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/powercom-countersues-facebook-over-data-portability/">lawsuits</a> against Facebook are fairly serious, but this one certainly isn't — we haven't seen litigation this amusing since the Attorney General of South Carolina <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/south-carolina-gives-craigslist-ultimatum-remove-prostitution-or-face-criminal-charges/">set his sights</a> on Craigslist to kick-start his campaign for governor.

Plaintiffs in the case appear to have engaged in run of the mill socializing on Facebook: sharing photos, writing status updates and similar things. They're then complaining that privacy, copyright and other rights are violated as people look at the photos, read the updates, etc. It's sort of like jumping into a pool and then complaining that you're wet.

The lawsuit complains about or at least insidiously describes pretty much every single part of Facebook, from the nefarious "wall" to a potentially incriminating "Data Analyst" job listing the company posted in 2007.  Oh, and the best part?  The AP and WSJ just <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090817/p92#a090817p92">reported</a> the case straight, without the slightest suggestion that the Plaintiffs might be a little off.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kitchsink.png" class="shot2"/>A new lawsuit filed against Facebook in the Superior Court of California in Orange County is one of the more entertaining documents we&#8217;ve had the pleasure of reading recently. A lot of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/powercom-countersues-facebook-over-data-portability/">lawsuits</a> against Facebook are fairly serious, but this one certainly isn&#8217;t — we haven&#8217;t seen litigation this amusing since the Attorney General of South Carolina <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/05/south-carolina-gives-craigslist-ultimatum-remove-prostitution-or-face-criminal-charges/">set his sights</a> on Craigslist to kick-start his campaign for governor.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs in the case appear to have engaged in run of the mill socializing on Facebook: sharing photos, writing status updates and similar things. They&#8217;re then complaining that privacy, copyright and other rights are violated as people look at the photos, read the updates, etc. It&#8217;s sort of like jumping into a pool and then complaining that you&#8217;re wet.</p>
<p>The lawsuit complains about or at least insidiously describes pretty much every single part of Facebook, from the nefarious &#8220;wall&#8221; to a potentially incriminating &#8220;Data Analyst&#8221; job listing the company posted in 2007.  Oh, and the best part?  The AP and WSJ just <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/090817/p92#a090817p92">reported</a> the case straight, without the slightest suggestion that the Plaintiffs might be a little off.  We&#8217;ve embedded the full, 40 page suit below.</p>
<p>So what are the Plantiffs accusing Facebook of?  The suit alleges that that Facebook is at its core a &#8220;data mining company.. [that] seeks to open and/or disseminate private information to third parties for commercial purposes and economic benefit&#8221; and that &#8220;Facebook has created a business model and apparatus designed to harvest as much personal and private information as possible in easiest, quickest, and most innocuous-looking manner possible.&#8221;  Cue the ominous music.  It gets better.</p>
<p>The complaints from the individual Plaintiffs involve everything from swine flu to &#8220;accomplished actresses&#8221;.  We&#8217;ve excerpted a couple of them below.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Plaintiff Xavier O. is an 11-year-old minor residing with his parents in Orange County, California.  Plaintiff Xavier O. has a Facebook account that was opened without the knowledge or consent of his parent or guardian.  Plaintiff Xavier O. has uploaded personal information, videos and photographs, including swimming and/or partially clothed photographs of children ages 5 to 11.  On or about August 8, 2009, Plaintiff Xavier O. posted &#8220;Xavier O. has swine flu&#8230; Please pray for me&#8230; God Bless.&#8221; Upon learning of the Facebook account and the posting of an uncertain medical condition, Plaintiff Xavier O&#8217;s parents removed the medical condition posting from Facebook.  Xavier O. and his parents have been unable to learn where the minor&#8217;s medical information may have been stored, disseminated or sold by Facebook.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote><p>Plaintiff Elvina Beck is an accomplished actress and model residing in Los Angeles, California. Plaintiff Beck has multiple commercial representatives/agents for print, commercial and theatrical work. Plaintiff Beck&#8217;s name, likeness and photos are highly valuable commercial assets. Plaintiff Beck appears in national print advertisements, commercials and films, and she is compensated for such work. Beck&#8217;s filmography includes Love Hurts, Privileged, CSI: New York, and ESPN 25. Plaintiff Beck&#8217;s digital images have been disseminated by Facebook without her consent, knowledge, or compensation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Plantiff is apparently objecting to the fact that Facebook has changed over the years from a college-only social network to a much broader one, and is unhappy with the way the site&#8217;s Terms of Service were modified over the years.  Except it&#8217;s quite common for sites to change their ToS without giving notice.  There goes that idea.</p>
<p>In short, the Plantiffs are complaining about many of the very mechanisms that make Facebook a social network. They&#8217;re also complaining about issues that have been addressed before — some of the concerns over content ownership issues are pretty explicitly spelled out in the site&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Terms</a>, which state &#8220;You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how we share your content through your privacy and application settings.&#8221; There may be some nuggets of validity hidden in here, but you&#8217;re going to have to look hard to find them.</p>
<p>Facebook has given us the following brief response regarding the suit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see no merit to this suit and we plan to fight it.</p></blockquote>

"Sources close to the company" say that the event will be on September 9th and will most assuredly not be Tablet-related.

While the inclusion of yet more services into Apple's increasingly bloated all-purpose media player may be seen as excessive, you can always count on Apple to at least <em>sell it.</em>]]></description>

This allows you to keep your browser bookmarks in sync no matter which of your computers you are using.

Syncing has been a standard feature of Apple's Safari browser for some months now, but you need to have MobileMe for it to work. And Firefox users could download add-ons like <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/">Xmarks</a> (previously called Foxmarks) to get the functionality, but with Chrome it will be built-in, and most importantly, unlike MobileMe, free.

This allows you to keep your browser bookmarks in sync no matter which of your computers you are using.</p>
<p>Syncing has been a standard feature of Apple&#8217;s Safari browser for some months now, but you need to have MobileMe for it to work. And Firefox users could download add-ons like <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/">Xmarks</a> (previously called Foxmarks) to get the functionality, but with Chrome it will be built-in, and most importantly, unlike MobileMe, free. Google notes that the bookmarks are stored on users&#8217; Google account alongside Google Docs and sync via XMPP.</p>
<p>To get the feature working, you apparently have to launch the dev version of Chrome with the &#8220;&#8211;enable-sync command-line flag&#8221;. If you understand what that means, you&#8217;re good to go. If not, you&#8217;ll probably want to wait for the feature to hit the regular release channel, something that will probably happen relatively soon.</p>
<p>Bookmark management appears to have been temporarily disabled on the latest versions of Chromium for Mac, after they were <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/12/chrome-for-mac-continues-march-forward-with-bookmarks-and-better-flash/">first turned on last week</a>. When they come back, hopefully this syncing will work for Macs as well.

The program was announced on July 13. Up to $100 million in employee common stock was to be purchased by Russian investment group <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/digital-sky-technologies">Digital Sky Technologies</a>, which also funded a separate <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/26/facebook-takes-that-200-million-investment-from-the-russians-at-a-10-billion-valuation/">$200 million</a> venture investment in May 2009. Employees, ex-employees and other common stockholders could participate, and had to indicate their intention to sell by early August.

People were limited to selling up to the lesser of 25% of their total holdings or $1 million. Shares are being purchased based on a $6.5 billion valuation.

Employees were given first dibs on stock sales, we've confirmed. Ex-employees were notified up front that they'd be able to sell only after current employees. And it turns out it made a difference - the ex-employees were cut back to "a small fraction" of the original amount requested. Some executives and larger shareholders may be able to sell additional stock via a separate arrangement, says our source.]]></description>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92872" title="blogger_logo" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/blogger_logo.png" alt="blogger_logo" width="259" height="258" />What were you doing in 1999? Maybe you were following the Kosovo War. Maybe you were starting to use Napster. Maybe you were entering your senior year of high school (I was). Or maybe you started blogging. After all, on August 23, 1999, <a href="http://www.pyra.com/">Pyra Labs</a> launched its <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> product, which would go on to become the biggest blogging platform in the world.</p>
<p>Yes, on Sunday, Blogger turns 10 years old. And to celebrate, the Blogger team (which is now a part of Google following a 2003 acquisition) is <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2009/08/blogger-is-turning-10.html">promising a bunch of gifts</a> to users in the form of new features. Without naming anything specifically, Blogger points to <a href="http://productideas.appspot.com/#15/e=e828&amp;t=d15f">this list</a> as a good reference point for some of what they&#8217;ll be rolling out over the next few weeks. Of note on that list are a better commenting system and WordPress-style pages (About page, etc).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Blogger&#8217;s roots are deeply tied to the new hot web platform of choice: Twitter. Pyra Labs was co-founded by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/evan-williams">Evan Williams</a>, who is now the CEO (and co-founder) of Twitter. Also a part of Pyra Labs were <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-goldman">Jason Goldman</a> who now runs product development for Twitter, and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-shellen">Jason Shellen</a> who now runs <a href="http://www.thinglabs.com/">Thing Labs</a>, the makers of <a href="http://brizzly.com">Brizzly</a>, a much <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/10/brizzly-a-twitter-reader-from-the-people-who-brought-you-google-reader/">buzzed-about</a> new Twitter client.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/biz-stone">Biz Stone</a>, another Twitter co-founder, joined the Blogger team at Google before leaving with Williams in 2004 to start Obvious Corp. which would eventually <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">birth</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/21/twitter-turns-three/">turn into</a> Twitter. (An interesting side note is that Williams&#8217; Pyra co-founder <a href="http://www.megnut.com/">Meg Hourihan</a>, eventually married <a href="http://kottke.org">Jason Kottke</a>, who is best known as being one of the web&#8217;s most popular bloggers.)</p>
<p>These days, while the web is abuzz over Twitter, no one really talks much about Blogger despite millions of people using it everyday. The fact is that as a platform, it has fallen behind the more nimble blogging platforms like WordPress and Tumblr in recent years. Still, in terms of straight up simplicity in setting up a blog, it&#8217;s easy to see why Blogger is still popular among users (and, unfortunately, spammers).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As as <a href="http://twitter.com/faridur">Faridur</a> notes in the comments, current Twitter Creative Director Douglas Bowman also worked on the Blogger team <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2004/05/09/blogger.html">back in the day</a>.</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-1851.png" class="shot2"/>Another month, another report that <a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a> is chiming slightly louder.   Analytics firm <a href="http://www.comscore.com">comScore</a> has just released its latest figures on search market share, and once again Microsoft&#8217;s search engine has managed to grow while its competitors have seen modest losses.</p>
<p>Bing <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/31/go-bing-yourself-right-now/">launched</a> to the public on May 31, when Microsoft held 8.0% search marketshare.  Over the course of June and July, the site has gained nearly a full percentage point — it&#8217;s up to 8.9%, and growth was actually higher for July than for June, when the site was getting all of its launch attention. Of course, Bing&#8217;s marketshare still pales in comparison to Google&#8217;s dominant 64.7%, but at least Microsoft is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>Once again, it looks like Bing&#8217;s gain comes at Yahoo&#8217;s expense, at least to some extent.  Since May, Yahoo has dropped from 20.1% to 19.3%.  Google has dropped a more modest .3%, from 65% to 64.7%.  We saw a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/bing-gains-some-search-share-from-yahoo/">similar pattern</a> last month, when we pointed out that Yahoo was losing marketshare both from below (Bing) and above (Google).  </p>
<p>Since then though, the landscape has changed dramatically: Yahoo search will soon be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/yahoo-got-binged/">powered by Bing</a>.  When the Yahoo/Microsoft search deal was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/yahoo-got-binged/">announced</a> Yahoo EVP Hillary Schneider discounted the impact of this market share erosion, stating, &#8220;seeing Bing as a live experience was a nice assurance but did not change our rationale or timing.&#8221;  But it&#8217;s hard to believe that Bing&#8217;s strong start didn&#8217;t have an impact on the deal.  </p>
<p>Once that deal comes to fruition Bing will have to face the real test: can it continue to take market share away from Google, or will it simply continue to eat away at itself as users move from Yahoo&#8217;s portal to the Bing homepage?<br />

While nothing is set in stone yet, it's looking pretty grim. The latest "Cupcake" Android update <a href="http://www.i4u.com/article26382.html">apparently pushed</a> the G1's memory to the limit.

That&#8217;s not to say Android isn&#8217;t a good mobile OS — it is, it&#8217;s just that the initial hardware built to run the OS didn&#8217;t do it justice. It was poorly designed and had a fairly cheap feel. And now, it appears that the G1 may already be on its last legs as Android engineers <a href="http://twitter.com/jbqueru/status/3314442822">aren&#8217;t sure</a> if the phone will be able to handle the upcoming updates to the Android OS.</p>
<p>While nothing is set in stone yet, it&#8217;s looking pretty grim. The latest &#8220;Cupcake&#8221; Android update <a href="http://www.i4u.com/article26382.html">apparently pushed</a> the G1&#8217;s memory to the limit. And subsequent updates should only require more. But what&#8217;s crazy about this is that the G1 was launched <em>just 10 months ago</em>. Certainly, the devices will keep working with the current flavor of Android, but just imagine the pain early adopters must feel if their device is already a dinosaur that they can&#8217;t upgrade, not yet a year into its release.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used the G1 pretty extensively, having obtained a demo unit from Google shortly after its launch. From just about day 1, I <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2008/11/08/the-t-mobile-g1-keyboard-a-lesson-in-failed-ergonomics/">didn&#8217;t like it</a>. The obvious comparison was to the iPhone, but it was a hard one to make since the devices were so different. The G1 had a physical keyboard, no multi-touch support, and could run applications in the background to name a few things. The better comparison is to the so-called &#8220;G2&#8243; also known as the &#8220;Google Ion&#8221; or the myTouch 3G. That device, also built by HTC, is similar to the G1 but <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/21/t-mobile-will-drop-its-second-android-phone-the-mytouch-3g-this-august-for-199/">improves on it in just about every way</a>. It&#8217;s faster, thinner (thanks to the removal of the awful keyboard), has better battery life, and just feels nicer.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-92830" title="tmobileg1-sb" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tmobileg1-sb.jpg" alt="tmobileg1-sb" width="227" height="418" />The myTouch is actually the device Mike switched to after <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/i-quit-the-iphone/">rejecting the iPhone</a>, and as I hear from him every time I see him, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/how-i-learned-to-quit-the-iphone-and-love-google-voice/">he loves it</a>. I don&#8217;t hear anyone say that about the G1. Sure, there are plenty of people who use it, and some like it, but I think all would concede that there are better phones out there. And if they won&#8217;t yet, when a new Android update comes out that the G1 can&#8217;t handle, I&#8217;m sure they will.</p>
<p>So big deal, a phone that a few hundred thousand people use is passing away before its time, right? Well the issue behind it is a potentially much larger one. The G1 going out of date speaks to a problem the Android platform has: Its open nature and the desire to support as many phones as possible is always going to leave some devices out in the cold.</p>
<p>Of course, that is hardly an Android-only problem, it&#8217;s a problem with just about every platform besides the iPhone. While the original iPhone has been out for over 2 years now, it was still able to be upgraded to the latest iPhone firmware, 3.0, this year. Granted, some of the features were disabled because the hardware has evolved, but it can still do the majority of things that the other iPhones can do.</p>
<p>With so many different devices, and many more said to be coming by the end of this year, the Android platform will continue to get fragmented in a way that is likely to be confusing to consumers. And that doesn&#8217;t even speak to the fragmentation of developers developing for phone-specific features of Android devices when more come out.</p>
<p>Of course, there are upsides to this openness, and we should see plenty of applications and features that aren&#8217;t available on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/the-case-against-apple-is-just-as-much-a-case-for-apple/">relatively-closed</a> iPhone. But it&#8217;s a tricky trade-off if consumers are buying a device that they&#8217;re not sure will work with all the applications on the platform, and worse, the newest versions of the OS itself.</p>
<p>Really, I just wanted to write a eulogy for the G1. I&#8217;m looking forward to some good Android phones in the future, the G1 was not one of them.</p>

A few thoughts:

<em>The Facebook Angle</em>

This is by far the most interesting angle to the deal. iLike is the most popular music application on Facebook, and is the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/23/facebook-dreams-of-easy-music-while-religious-battle-rages-internally/">de facto Facebook Music app</a>. That company will shortly be owned by MySpace, Facebook's primary competitor. That puts Facebook in a lose-lose situation. They can let iLike continue to dominate the music scene on Facebook and let MySpace own all that. Or they can ban iLike and lose all credibility with their platform - everyone would know iLike was banned because of the acquisition by MySpace. And it doesn't have to be an outright ban. Facebook has plenty of subtle ways of trainwrecking an application they don't like. Keep an eye on this.

Why didn't Facebook just buy iLike? A matching or slightly better offer than the $20 million MySpace is paying would likely have gotten the deal done. And it may have saved Facebook from an embarrassing situation.

If I were MySpace, I'd focus on getting their free streaming music into the iLike Facebook application as soon as possible. Advertisers will love it.

<p>Why didn&#8217;t Facebook just buy iLike? A matching or slightly better offer than the $20 million MySpace is paying would likely have gotten the deal done. And it may have saved Facebook from an embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>If I were MySpace, I&#8217;d focus on getting their free streaming music into the iLike Facebook application as soon as possible. Advertisers will love it.</p>
<p>This deal also shows what a top Facebook app is worth. Most of iLike&#8217;s activity comes through Facebook. They have 10 million monthly active users, and 31 million total Facebook installations (iLike has a total of over 50 million registered users). MySpace has valued that and the rest of iLike at $20 million, but has to factor in the possibility that Facebook will derail the application, subtly or overtly. If that risk wasn&#8217;t there, my guess is iLike would be worth 2-3x as much.</p>
<p><em>Why is MySpace and not MySpace Music buying iLike?</em> </p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing two reasons.The first is that MySpace Music, a joint venture with the music labels, isn&#8217;t going too well. The venture will lose at least $20 million this year on the back of massive royalty payments to the labels, and when the Google search deal <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/17/breaking-myspace-close-to-acquiring-ilike/">ends next year</a> the financial prospects of MySpace Music may get much, much worse. The last thing MySpace wants to do is put good money after bad and throw more assets into MySpace Music. Plus, the deal would likely have required notice to, if not the approval of, the label partners who own equity in the joint venture. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s another reason being talked about by our sources as well, though. iLike isn&#8217;t just about music and music recommendations. The platform they&#8217;ve built to facilitate artist-to-user publishing and user-to-user recommendations can be used for content beyond music, such as videos and games. Our guess is MySpace intends to integrate iLike&#8217;s technology into more than artist pages. So having the assets at MySpace makes sense.</p>
<p><em>MySpace Now Has Its Own Music Download Deals With Labels.</em></p>
<p>iLike launched its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/ilike-just-launched-its-own-music-download-store/">music download store</a> last week. MySpace Music has streaming rights to music but not download sales rights. Today <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/amazon-to-power-upcoming-myspace-music-downloads/">Amazon powers MySpace Music downloads</a>. I&#8217;m sure MySpace is now considering (or already decided to) moving to a direct sales approach via iLike&#8217;s deals and software.</p>

<strong>A Manifesto</strong></p>
<p>I believe in <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter">Twitter</a>. I believe people want to use it and that it is useful to them. I&#8217;m less sure of its susceptibility to monetization, but then again, I cover <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/10/comparing-a-red-one-5d-mk-ii-and-panasonic-gh1-highly-illogical/">cameras </a>and <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/06/ramen-robot-makes-800-bowls-a-day-thats-almost-enough-for-me/">ramen-bots</a>, not internet business. Still, since I&#8217;m coming down to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch50.com/2009/blog/">TechCrunch 50</a> conference in a few weeks, and will likely be the only person attending who does <em>not</em> use Twitter, I felt I should furnish an explanation. Not that I think it really matters to anyone whether I use it or not, but by striking preemptively, I&#8217;ll avoid talking myself hoarse in explaining it repeatedly to those of you I meet. I&#8217;m also curious to see if there are any other &#8220;abstwainers&#8221; (or better yet, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotal">Tweetotallers</a>,&#8221; either way I&#8217;ve coined a term) in the TechCrunch readership, and if so, what your perspective is.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I hadn&#8217;t been waiting for a chance to express myself on this (which may be why it is so <em>very </em>long (though my parenthetical style of writing shares the blame)), but it seems relevant enough and the timing is right. Please bear in mind that these are <em>my own reasons</em> for not using the service, not reasons for you to stop; I don&#8217;t mean to proselytize. I&#8217;ll start with my primary assertion: that a tweet is fundamentally valueless.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twitter-bird-logo.jpg" alt="twitter-bird-logo" title="twitter-bird-logo" width="300" height="170" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107003" /><strong>Tweets have no value</strong></p>
<p>What is a tweet? It is a quantity of data which I believe to be useless, at least in this context. <strong>What can be said in 140 characters is either trivial or abridged; in the first case it would be better not to say it at all, and in the second case it would be better to give it the space it deserves.</strong> Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: &#8220;It&#8217;s a boy!&#8221; for instance, is both sufficient and worth telling everyone you know (incidentally, congratulations to CrunchGear writer Matt on the new baby), but I think we all know that the bulk of Twitter is not life-changing announcements or granules of compact wit and wisdom. Nor is it meant to be &mdash; but <em>intentions</em> aren&#8217;t admissible in <em>my</em> court, sir.</p>
<p>To proceed: the &#8220;this context&#8221; I mentioned above is simply that tweets are broadcast indiscriminately. I think this further devalues them; an otherwise acceptable message (&#8221;Brunch at Hi-Spot at 1!&#8221;) becomes impersonal and meaningless when it&#8217;s sent to so many. Yes, there is @ for specifying another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something else, this accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just exacerbates things. I like to think of it this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time &mdash; and shouting mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody&#8217;s name before the mundanity. Everyone else still has to listen. Conversation is impossible; every exchange is telegraphic (as is, unfortunately, increasingly true in other media).</p>
<p>But the tweet can have a link in it, of course, which makes it more versatile &mdash; except links are subject to the same value reductions as simple text. Tweeting a link is a lot like sending it to your whole address book. If you think <em>everyone you know</em> should see it, it better be <em>worth</em> shouting from the mountaintops. How rare that is! If you like other people finding your content for you, on their schedule, this isn&#8217;t a problem, but for me it is. Add in the fact that probably half of tweets are automatically generated, and what we&#8217;ve got here is a failure to communicate anything of value.</p>
<p>The natural objection to this is that you choose to follow people, you don&#8217;t have it forced upon you. True! I say, then, if someone is so regularly finding content of merit, why don&#8217;t they have a <em>blog</em> where the content can be given context, discussion, and perhaps a preview so people aren&#8217;t going in blind? I <em>like</em> reading interesting blogs. I <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to receive links every time someone find something they think everyone should see. Twitter just adds another layer to the equation &mdash; and I don&#8217;t like layers.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Every tweet out there is either unnecessary or unnecessarily abbreviated. Why would anyone <em>want</em> to be the owner of such an awkward little package of data?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/incomplete.png" alt="incomplete" title="incomplete" width="200" height="181" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107005" /><strong>It&#8217;s incomplete</strong></p>
<p>This one might be controversial, but I embrace controversy. I make it uncomfortable. I put my hands in its back pockets. I kiss it on the lips. Twitter, therefore, I say is an incomplete and clumsy service. The halo of Twitter meta-services is indicative (in my opinion) less of the popularity of the service and more of how it falls short of the mark. When it isn&#8217;t down, Twitter provides A; people want A, B, and C.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just text, sure, that&#8217;s what makes it Twitter &mdash; but simplicity isn&#8217;t the same as elegance (though the two are often seen together). URL-shortened image hosting services suggest people want to put their images right in the tweet-stream, or whatever you call it. Twitter applications like Tweetdeck (that&#8217;s one, right?) suggest that the web service is inadequate. And so on.</p>
<p>One <em>could</em> exaggerate the scope of Twitter&#8217;s service to being an alternative communication protocol at a basic level, like email or IM, and say that clients are a natural extension of that &mdash; but I think that&#8217;s disingenuous and wrong. Wrong because Twitter is meant to be <em>simple</em>, not <em>fundamental</em>. It&#8217;s a significant difference. Disingenuous because you know that&#8217;s not the case: if it were, Twitter would be better integrated with existing services.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not blaming Twitter for not being what <em>I</em> would have liked it to be &mdash; but to jump on a service that looks like a transitional form, so to speak, seems unwise if there is no utility in it. I&#8217;ll get on at Twitter 2.0, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>It replaces nothing and adds nothing</strong></p>
<p>What did you do before you tweeted? It&#8217;s the social equivalent of an all points bulletin, or&#8230; a quasar or something. What did you do before when you needed to send something of little consequence or urgency to a bunch of people who may or may not want to see it? The only thing that comes to mind is skywriting. Nowadays there are more ways than I can count. Twitter is certainly a big one, but is it really better, easier, or faster than its competitors &mdash; say, Facebook&#8217;s feed? To the untrained eye (that is to say, to <em>my </em>eye), it looks as if Facebook has Twitter humbled in many ways (though if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m not much of a Facebooker either).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/whynot.png" alt="whynot" title="whynot" width="536" height="100" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107001" /></p>
<p>Twitter is certainly more mobile &mdash; that much I grant it; Facebook should be much better at that, and the FriendFeed acquisition should sew that up pretty tight in the months to come. Twitter is certainly much better for featurephones (as opposed to smartphones), but that&#8217;s a bit of a moving target, since featurephones are getting smart and smartphones are getting cheap. If I took a picture of something crazy with my phone, I&#8217;d rather send it to Facebook than Twitter, though with Twitter it would probably reach more people, because Facebook&#8217;s feed is almost as simple, and far more robust. It&#8217;s worth mentioning here that I&#8217;m pretty much talking out of my ass, though, because I&#8217;m not an especially active user of Facebook, and I may have mentioned that I don&#8217;t use Twitter at all. But if you would forbid the <em>argument ad ignorantium</em>, well, there goes the entire internet.</p>
<p><strong>News breaks alike on the followed and the unfollowed</strong></p>
<p>As for spreading news, there I can see it might be helpful for some. Not that the same news that gets broken on Twitter couldn&#8217;t have been broken somewhere else, but Twitter news does have a certain something. A certain urgency, since it&#8217;s part of an expanding wave of retweets, and you&#8217;re expected to tweet it forward. I&#8217;m sure some of you are wondering how a blogger can get by without using Twitter (Matt Hickey is, at least). I would remind you that this article is appearing on TechCrunch, the world&#8217;s leading source of Twitter-based news. Every tweet coming into existence has to be <em>personally approved</em> by Mike and MG before it appears for the rest of the internet. With these guys on watch, I&#8217;ve got nothing to worry about. (They could stand to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.80c182849ca932a32a5eda49e4fe1b02.3b1&#038;show_article=1">filter a bit more though</a>)</p>
<p>The point is that I don&#8217;t see any particular reason to use Twitter rather than, say, relying on Facebook or RSS or even email. If it&#8217;s hot, it&#8217;ll spread one way or the other. And unfortunately, I can&#8217;t think of a less suggestive way of saying that.</p>
<p>Besides, (and I hate to trot out this old argument, but I think it&#8217;s applicable here) weren&#8217;t we saturated with information <em>before</em> Twitter came on the scene? Do we really need a constant hail of tweets in addition to the emails, IMs, messages, posts, votes, invitations, events, feeds, and god knows what else? I say thee nay! And on that point:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vanity.jpg" alt="vanity" title="vanity" width="250" height="393" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107016" /><strong>It&#8217;s pure vanity</strong></p>
<p>This may sound a bit rich coming from a <em>professional blogger</em>, but I don&#8217;t like to broadcast myself. Before this post I have tried to restrict my self-reference on this blog and CrunchGear to things like &#8220;I&#8217;m more of a Canon guy, but&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;SNES will always be superior to Genesis.&#8221; I think advertising yourself overtly or deliberately drawing attention is in poor taste, whether it&#8217;s tweeting your latest action, or having really big hair, or making everyone listen to your joke at a party. Vanity! Twitter encourages it. This is more of a philosophical point, so I won&#8217;t argue it too much here, but it&#8217;s my position that people should be saying fewer, more meaningful things, directed at people to whom they are relevant &mdash; as opposed to the equivalent of sending up a signal flare and screaming that you super hate mondays, blah!</p>
<p>It appeals to the reptilian part of the brain, I think. It&#8217;s an alpha male thing, having followers. When you&#8217;re broadcasting, you get to think people are paying attention, and who doesn&#8217;t like attention? But our attention is spread so thin these days that the portion devoted to something as minor as a tweet may as well be none at all. Broadcasting may console the ego, but it&#8217;s false consolation. What it is a surrogate for (meaningful attention) can&#8217;t be gotten that way.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you tweet?</strong></p>
<p>But enough of that. I could probably rattle off a couple more paragraphs on this and that, but I don&#8217;t want to abuse the reader&#8217;s patience. 1800 words is 1796 too many, when I could have simply pulled a Bartleby and said &#8220;I prefer not to.&#8221; You must understand, I thought it worth a thorough examining, considering TechCrunch and Twitter are joined at the hip. I console myself in that this article, though overlong to a degree you all will be revealing to me shortly, has still far fewer words than are found in an average week&#8217;s posts on Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/why-we-tweet.jpg" alt="why-we-tweet" title="why-we-tweet" width="200" height="134" class="alignright size-full wp-image-107022" />So here&#8217;s my question to you. <strong>Why do you, or why don&#8217;t you, use Twitter?</strong> This isn&#8217;t a trap; I&#8217;m genuinely curious, since it seems to provide some things for many, many things for some, and nothing to a (talented and handsome) few. Anything so polarizing is worth discussion, so &mdash; discuss.</p>
<p>I only forbid one answer: &#8220;because everyone else is doing it.&#8221; That&#8217;s the same reason people wore Hammer pants.</p>

That's odd since the service has now gone from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">completely shutting down</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/trim-cuts-off-bitlys-301works-idea-wants-to-sell/">trying hard to sell</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/trim-we-were-just-kidding-about-cutting-you-off-also-were-still-for-sale/">bringing the service back up</a> so it can sell, to now going open source in just 8 days.

Let me be clear, going open source is a great idea, I'm not sure if it will <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">help Tr.im all that much</a>, but on paper it sounds great. That's what they should have done originally. But <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/165049236/tr-im-to-be-community-owned">in a post today</a> on Tr.im's blog the service first apologizes for this whole fiasco, and then attempts to place blame elsewhere. As I read it, it's either Bit.ly's fault for making a low-ball offer to buy the Tr.im, Twitter's fault for picking Bit.ly over Tr.im as its URL shortener of choice, <a href="http://301works.org/">301works.org</a>'s fault for being a "public relations stunt", and yes, even TechCrunch's fault because we "simply repeat vertbatim what twitter/bit.ly feeds [us]".]]></description>

That&#8217;s odd since the service has now gone from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/">completely shutting down</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/trim-cuts-off-bitlys-301works-idea-wants-to-sell/">trying hard to sell</a>, to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/11/trim-we-were-just-kidding-about-cutting-you-off-also-were-still-for-sale/">bringing the service back up</a> so it can sell, to now going open source in just 8 days.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, going open source is a great idea, I&#8217;m not sure if it will <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/despite-all-the-angst-around-its-demise-trim-will-hardly-be-missed/">help Tr.im all that much</a>, but on paper it sounds great. That&#8217;s what they should have done originally. But <a href="http://blog.tr.im/post/165049236/tr-im-to-be-community-owned">in a post today</a> on Tr.im&#8217;s blog the service first apologizes for this whole fiasco, and then attempts to place blame elsewhere. As I read it, it&#8217;s either Bit.ly&#8217;s fault for making a low-ball offer to buy the Tr.im, Twitter&#8217;s fault for picking Bit.ly over Tr.im as its URL shortener of choice, <a href="http://301works.org/">301works.org</a>&#8217;s fault for being a &#8220;public relations stunt&#8221;, and yes, even TechCrunch&#8217;s fault because we &#8220;simply repeat vertbatim what twitter/bit.ly feeds [us]&#8220;.</p>
<p>Let me again be clear: We received no shortage of tips from very good sources last week about what Tr.im was doing behind the scenes while all of this played out. Not one of those tips was from either Bit.ly or Twitter or anyone directly related to them. Instead, they came from third-parties who were actively or passively pursuing a Tr.im acquisition. For example, we heard the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/nambu-wants-80k-100k-for-trim-considers-shutting-down-its-twitter-client/">$80,000 to $100,000 figure</a> Nambu wanted for Tr.im from no less than three sources. And even more sources came forward to say they had heard that general price range as well and thought it was unreasonable, especially considering how Nambu handled the Tr.im situation, losing user trust in the process. So is it really any surprise today that they announce they&#8217;re going open source?</p>
<p>Does it suck that Twitter&#8217;s choice of Bit.ly made it hard for services like Tr.im to operate? Sure. But plenty of others are still out there doing it rather than descending into conspiracy theories. And it&#8217;s just poor form to drag other services into this mess, like <a href="http://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a>, which is trying to do a good thing with 301works.org. Yes, it was Bit.ly&#8217;s idea, but Gnip is now handling it as a independant third-party, and no shortage of other URL shortening services have joined on. Obviously, some of those services probably don&#8217;t like that Twitter chose Bit.ly, but they deal with it and realize that a movement like this is worth teaming up with rivals for the good of all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It saddens me that this is how Tr.im is portraying 301works,</em>&#8221; Gnip&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-marcoullier">Eric Marcoullier</a> told us today. He went on to reiterate that Gnip is simply serving as an <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/14/following-the-trim-incident-301works-is-ready-to-insure-shortened-urls/">independant third party for the project</a>, attempting to do something good and useful. And while <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/trim_to_go_open_source_community_owned.php">a ReadWriteWeb article</a> on the matter today seemed to suggest that Tr.im was working actively with Gnip for this new crowd-sourced Tr.im, Marcoullier notes that anyone is free to push data through Gnip, but that he hasn&#8217;t specifically talked to Nambu about how Tr.im will use it. He also notes that since Tr.im will now be open source, he hopes the community behind it makes its data a part of 301works.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Tr.im to try and clear up their misplaced anger about this, but have yet to hear back. If we do, we will update.</p>

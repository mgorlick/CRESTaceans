<p>Users of the online feed reader are <a href="http://blogs.newsgator.com/daily/2009/07/newsgator-consumer-rss-reader-product-changes-google-sync.html">kindly requested</a> to migrate their subscriptions over to Google Reader before August 31, and NewsGator will provide <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/productinfo/producttransition.aspx">step-by-step instructions</a> and in-product reminders to make sure all goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Speaking of NewsGator&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/default.aspx">desktop RSS readers</a>, which include FeedDemon for Windows and NetNewsWire for Macs, they have both been updated to a new version. Users of the software programs are asked to download the updated versions in the next 30 days, and in another testament to the company&#8217;s friendly relationship with Mountain View it is mostly touting the new synchronization feature with Google Reader as a selling point. The programs are offered free of charge, but that hasn&#8217;t always been the case; in fact they announced they would be <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/09/newsgator-upgrades-rss-readers-provides-them-for-free/">waiving the cost of the products</a> in January 2008.</p>
<p>NewsGator&#8217;s focus on its paying, enterprise-grade products <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/12/newsgators-focus-on-business-customers-is-paying-off/">makes a lot of sense</a>. just yesterday, the company released an announcement about the momentum for its enterprise social networking product <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/business/socialsites/default.aspx">Social Sites</a>, which recently hit the milestone of 1 million paying users. Earlier this year, we published an <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/01/15/is-enterprise-rss-dead-newsgator-ceo-who-cares/">interesting interview</a> conducted with JB Holston, Newsgator’s CEO, in which he explains their focus on enterprise RSS even if they never call it that themselves.</p>
<p>NewsGator has raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newsgator">$39 million</a> to date , mostly from Mobius Venture Capital and Masthead Venture Partners.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-148-185x200.png" width="185" height="200" />You know those idiotic commenters on Digg? Sure you do. You know, "FIRST", "LOLZ", "URGAY", etc. Yeah, those guys. Well Digg took a step today that could possibly make them at least 10,000 times more annoying: <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=921">Email alerts</a>.

Now, let's be clear: This doesn't mean that people who post an item on Digg will get alerts every time someone comments — that would be awful. Instead, this means that if you leave a comment on an item, you will get alerted when someone comments on that. And this will occur only for top-level comments and not nested ones.

And while that may not sound so bad, it's no secret that Digg, like many big sites, has a comment section that is almost completely run by trolls. It takes actions to combat that, such as the burying and promoting of certain comments, but this new email alert system will bypass that.]]></description>

Sure you do. You know, &#8220;FIRST&#8221;, &#8220;LOLZ&#8221;, &#8220;URGAY&#8221;, etc. Yeah, those guys. Well Digg took a step today that could possibly make them at least 10,000 times more annoying: <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=921">Email alerts</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s be clear: This doesn&#8217;t mean that people who post an item on Digg will get alerts every time someone comments — that would be awful. Instead, this means that if you leave a comment on an item, you will get alerted when someone comments on that. And this will occur only for top-level comments and not nested ones.</p>

<p>So if I want to leave an insightful comment on Digg, my inbox is now likely to get overwhelmed by the random garbage comments left in response. Sure, some of them may be thoughtful replies, but in my experience, most will be rubbish. And that&#8217;s fine, but just don&#8217;t email them to me. But Digg is, by default.</p>
<p>You can turn the email alerts off <a href="http://digg.com/settings/email">on this page</a>. Or, perhaps even easier, you could just do what plenty of Digg users do, and not comment.</p>

You know how when Maurice in accounting or Lydia on the dev team breaks a hip or has a birthday? And how Sarah in HR goes around collecting cash for a present for them? And how you have to fish out a ten-spot, the same ten-spot you were planning on using for lunch and now you have to use the ATM which isn't your bank and costs $2 to use? And how you're all like "Maybe tomorrow" and Sarah is all like "OK. I'll put you down for tomorrow but I have to go to get the Bed, Bath and Beyond gift certificate tonight so don't forget." And you're all like "Wait, here's ten." And Sarah thinks you're a freak?

Well, Lolligift solves all that. By sending your co-workers <a HREF="http://lolligift.com/pools/213">a single link</a> (I will totally laugh if anyone donates to Nik's fund) they can begin sending cash. You then collect the funds via Paypal (less $5 and Paypal's cut) or request a free mailed check or Visa Check Card. You can overnight the check for $19.95.

<p>The site is run by former Microsoft employees who, I&#8217;m sure, had to put a lot of cash into Bill Gates&#8217; annual birthday Lamborghini pool and therefore have extended experience in the &#8220;giving at the office&#8221; field. Presumably they&#8217;re making their money on holding the deposited cash in a bank account and on the $5 fees.</p>
<p>Founders Adam Sheppard and William Lai is part of the <a HREF="http://8ninths.com/">8ninths incubator</a> in Seattle. It&#8217;s privately held and funded.</p>
<p>As you see it&#8217;s simple to create a pool for almost anything. You enter the recipient, the gift, and then event time. The site then emails the participants.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scaledlolly2-2_jpg.jpg"><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/scaledlolly2-2_jpg.jpg" alt="scaledlolly2-2_jpg" title="scaledlolly2-2_jpg" width="630" height="466" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-88291" /></a></p>
<p>Like <a HREF="http://www.evite.com">evite</a>, <a HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a> and <a HREF="http://www.socializr.com/">socializer</a> and all of those party invite systems you&#8217;ll use this site rarely but once you realize it&#8217;s there, you&#8217;ll probably keep using it. However it does make it much harder to skip out on office gift pools.</p>

The conventional wisdom out there on Web video advertising is that most advertisers don't want to risk being associated with user-generated videos (i.e., the vast bulk of videos on YouTube).  It is only the professionally-produced stuff on portions of YouTube and Hulu and Blip.tv where the advertising dollars are going.  This is the conventional wisdom because it is mostly true.

But YouTube wants to change advertiser's minds (because the vast bulk of its videos are audience-produced, did we mention that?).  So in a <a href=" http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-now-pronounce-you-monetized-youtube.html">blog post</a> today, YouTube trots out a told-ya-so case study about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94JhLEiN0">"JK Wedding Entrance Video" </a> (embedded below) that has been spreading around like crazy.  Since it was posted on July 19, it has been watched more than 12 million times.  ]]></description>

<p>The conventional wisdom out there on Web video advertising is that most advertisers don&#8217;t want to risk being associated with user-generated videos (i.e., the vast bulk of videos on YouTube).  It is only the professionally-produced stuff on portions of YouTube and Hulu and Blip.tv where the advertising dollars are going.  This is the conventional wisdom because it is mostly true.</p>
<p>But YouTube wants to change advertiser&#8217;s minds (because the vast bulk of its videos are audience-produced, did we mention that?).  So in a <a href=" http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-now-pronounce-you-monetized-youtube.html">blog post</a> today, YouTube trots out a told-ya-so case study about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94JhLEiN0">&#8220;JK Wedding Entrance Video&#8221; </a> (embedded below) that has been spreading around like crazy.  Since it was posted on July 19, it has been watched more than 12 million times.  It&#8217;s even spawned its own (professionally-produced) faux sequel, the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbr2ao86ww0">JK Divorce Entrance Dance&#8221;</a> (also embedded below).</p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t seen it, the original video shows an entire wedding party boogieing down the aisle in Minnesota.  Instead of a traditional wedding march, the couple picked Chris Brown&#8217;s &#8220;Forever.&#8221;  YouTube&#8217;s content fingerprinting system picked that up and the copyright holders were able to place <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/07/still-searching-for-a-video-business-model-google-introduces-the-youtubevertorial/">click-to-buy ads </a>on the video which linked to downloads of the song on iTunes and Amazon.  </p>
<p>YouTube reports that the click-through rate on those ads was two times higher than the overall click-through rate for those types of ads on the site, and that there was even a spillover effect on official &#8220;Forever&#8221; music video, which also saw the click-through rate son the same ads go up 2.5 times the average.  (It makes sense that would be higher since people going to the official video presumably are more interested in the song itself).  </p>
<p>Not only that, but &#8220;Forever&#8221; climbed the music charts, reaching the No. 4 spot <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/top-100/songs/">on iTunes</a> (it is now No. 15) and No. 3 spot on Amazon&#8217;s MP3 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/dmusic/digital-music-track/ref=pd_ts_dmusic_nav">top seller&#8217;s list</a> (it is currently No. 4).  Not bad for a song that was released a year ago.</p>
<p>YouTube presents this as proof that advertising works on viral videos even if they are audience produced.  I&#8217;m not sure it proves anything other than that breakout videos are good advertising vehicles no matter where they come from.  But YouTube needs to sell more of its video inventory to get to profitability, and the bulk of it is . . . </p>

Officially, Redux says it's a "personalized entertainment guide to the web." But really, that's what most social sites are these days. We need new features to distinguish them. And solid usability. And that's what Redux offers in this video area.

The main problem I have with online video is that there's way too much of it. I visit YouTube, but I have no idea what to watch. If I try to browse random videos, most of it is crap, and really, it's just a waste of my time to do that.

But a new feature is fairly awesome. &#8220;TV&#8221; allows you to easily share video clips, just as you would share links on FriendFeed or Redux&#8217;s main Stream area.</p>
<p>Officially, Redux says it&#8217;s a &#8220;personalized entertainment guide to the web.&#8221; But really, that&#8217;s what most social sites are these days. We need new features to distinguish them. And solid usability. And that&#8217;s what Redux offers in this video area.</p>
<p>The main problem I have with online video is that there&#8217;s way too much of it. I visit YouTube, but I have no idea what to watch. If I try to browse random videos, most of it is crap, and really, it&#8217;s just a waste of my time to do that. Most of the videos I consume, friends send me, and that&#8217;s exactly the idea behind Redux&#8217;s video area. (Finding and consuming videos in a stream is also the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/24/our-first-taste-of-magma/">idea behind Magma</a>, which is still in private beta).  But because it&#8217;s an actual video player, the sharing and watching of videos is seamless.</p>
<p>You go to the area and you are served up videos that your friends have liked (or, given &#8220;props&#8221; to, in their words). If you like the video too, you can mark it as such, and it will send it to your other friends. You can also comment on the video, right from the player.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting here trying to write this post, but I find myself lost in video watching now, it&#8217;s quite addictive. Sure, FriendFeed and other services allow you to share videos and watch them from within the service, but the way Redux does it is much nicer, and makes it easier to lose yourself in the content.</p>
<p>The idea behind all of this is a larger one. &#8220;In 2-3 years when we turn on our TV we&#8217;ll have the same content discovery problem,&#8221; Redux co-founder <span class="gI">David McIntosh tells us. The site has been around for about 5 months now in private testing. So far, there are over 5,000 users, but now it&#8217;s time to expand. </span></p>
<p><span class="gI">As such Redux is making 500 invites available to TechCrunch readers. Simply <a href="http://www.redux.com/signup/tc">follow this link</a> to sign up.</span></p>
<p><span class="gI">So what&#8217;s the business model behind all of this? Well, it&#8217;s two-fold. First, there will eventually be video advertisements placed in the video section. The other idea is based around micropayments. Say you like the show Mad Men, and only want to see content related to it, you could pay a small fee and get access to just that content. There is also the possibility of using micropayments to give users &#8220;super prop&#8221; privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="gI">Right now the video clips only include YouTube, but we&#8217;re told additional services will be added in the future.<br />

The service is already running into frustrating <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">opposition</a> from Apple and possibly AT&#038;T (depending on who you believe). Today, it's getting opposition of a different kind: <a href="http://www.3jam.com">3jam</a>, a company that until now has primarily offered services that revolve around SMS messaging, is expanding to offer telephony services that will be going head to head against Google Voice.



3jam offers many of the same core features offered by Google Voice, including the ability to have one phone number ring multiple phones, as well as an online interface for managing voicemail and text messages, though there are some more advanced features that it lacks (more on that later).  But it does have a few features that Google Voice doesn't, like the ability to receive calls on Skype, AOL, and Yahoo Messenger (why waste minutes when you're sitting in front your your computer anyway?)]]></description>

The service is already running into frustrating <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">opposition</a> from Apple and possibly AT&#038;T (depending on who you believe). Today, it&#8217;s getting opposition of a different kind: <a href="http://www.3jam.com">3jam</a>, a company that until now has primarily offered services that revolve around SMS messaging, is expanding to offer telephony services that will be going head to head against Google Voice.</p>
<p>3jam offers many of the same core features offered by Google Voice, including the ability to have one phone number ring multiple phones, as well as an online interface for managing voicemail and text messages, though there are some more advanced features that it lacks (more on that later).  But it does have a few features that Google Voice doesn&#8217;t, like the ability to receive calls on Skype, AOL, and Yahoo Messenger (why waste minutes when you&#8217;re sitting in front your your computer anyway?)</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3jam1.png"/></p>
<p>3jam also has some impressive SMS functionality, which makes sense given the company&#8217;s history with SMS.  One of these is a group SMS chat, that lets you designate a new phone number as a &#8216;group number&#8217; and then pick out which of your contacts is in your group.  Every time someone within the group sends a message to that number, it will be sent to everyone else in the group as well.  Outsiders can attempt to send messages to the special number, but it won&#8217;t have any effect.</p>
<p>3jam is also trying to tackle one of the biggest problems facing Google Voice: number portability, which allows you to transfer your current phone number to the new service.  We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/google-voices-secret-weapon-number-portability/">heard</a> that Google is trying to work out the details to get his feature out the door some time this year, but it poses many logistical problems.  For one, users could potentially cancel their carrier contracts on accident, leading to hefty fees.  And the wait to get a number transfered from the carrier to the service can take weeks.  But that isn&#8217;t stopping 3jam.  The company is letting users transfer their numbers despite these hurdles, though users will be warned that the process may take as long as 45 days.  </p>
<p>So 3jam has some things going for it, but it still lags behind Google Voice in some key areas. 3jam lacks many of Google Voice&#8217;s more advanced features, like call filtering options — Google Voice lets you set up lists of users and filter calls accordingly (for example I could send certain people straight to voicemail after 6PM but let my family call me at any time), while 3jam doesn&#8217;t offer any similar features.  And 3jam costs money, with plans starting at around $5 a month (Google Voice is free for most features).</p>
<p>Of course, the market for this kind of service is huge, so 3jam may have a chance even with Google Voice in the same space, but it still has many obstacles ahead. The concept is still quite novel to most people, and some may resist putting their telephony service in the hands of a startup.  And 3Jam is going to have to face the same problems Google has when it tries to bring its service to smartphone handsets, though carriers may be less intimated by a startup than they are of Google.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, 3jam is off to a fairly good start.  The company is offereing a white label product that has been licensed by <a href="http://www.getpeek.com/">Peek</a>, a company that makes small mobile communication devices.  Now for the bigger challenge: getting normal people to understand and sign up for the service.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-416-215x143.png" width="215" height="143" />We've all seen the ads and screenshots that pop-up when you hover over keywords on blogs. For the most part, they're annoying. But what if those pop-ups had actual useful information in them? That's the idea behind <a href="http://www.panels.net/">Panels Network</a>.

A key feature of these overlays is that they're not just about links, they also pop-up over ads. So, for example, when you hover over a 125x125 ad on TechCrunch (see an example on <a href="http://panels.net/demo/techcrunch/">this demo page</a>), you can find out information about the advertiser. Think of them as kind of like an excerpt from Wikipedia about the company.]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88183" title="picture-416" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-416.png" alt="picture-416" width="337" height="225" />We&#8217;ve all seen the ads and screenshots that pop-up when you hover over keywords on blogs. For the most part, they&#8217;re annoying. But what if those pop-ups had actual useful information in them? That&#8217;s the idea behind <a href="http://www.panels.net/">Panels Network</a>.</p>
<p>A key feature of these overlays is that they&#8217;re not just about links, they also pop-up over ads. So, for example, when you hover over a 125&#215;125 ad on TechCrunch (see an example on <a href="http://panels.net/demo/techcrunch/">this demo page</a>), you can find out information about the advertiser. Think of them as kind of like an excerpt from Wikipedia about the company.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just standard information about the company. These panels also house screenshots of the company&#8217;s website, a map of where they are located, any recent news about the company, job listings, financial news, reviews, and also the ability to shop (if applicable). And the panels remember what section you last clicked on, so the information you find most relevant will always be front and center.</p>
<p>The idea is to make the ads more useful, by giving more information about the companies. As a result of this, they&#8217;re seeing a 50% to 500% increase in click-throughs, Panels Network CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/craig-barnes">Craig Barnes</a> tells us.</p>
<p>So how does Panels make money off of any of this? Well, the idea at first is advertising. Around 20% of Panels are taken up by contextual ads. But eventually, the company has more elaborate plans, including possibly working with companies to tailor their own panels, and control the way they are shown on other sites.</p>
<p>The service, opening in beta today, will be free, at least initially. But the company is being selective for who they will let in at first, with only a few hundred users being allowed to sign up. Installing the panels on your site is as easy as placing a line of code on the page.</p>
<p>Down the line, Panels Network also hopes to make an iPhone app with the same information you see in the panels. The idea there is to get users used to the idea of the information found in the panels.</p>
<p>The Portland, Oregon-based company has raised $2.5 million from Barnes as well as several angel investors, so far.</p>

The <a href="http://Tweetmic.com">Tweetmic</a> iPhone app has been gathering lots of speed in the U.S. due to its ability to publish on Twitter - but it has no attached social network. But it's <a href="http://www.audioboo.fm/">AudioBoo.fm</a>, launched in December last year, which has been making waves with an iPhone-only app which works very well.

However, a new entrant, <a href="http://www.ipadio.com/">ipadio</a>, is potentially about to steal AudioBoo's thunder with a new iPhone app which covers all the bases: live streaming audio into a web page; high quality uploads from the iPhone; live phone-in service; upcoming Android app - plus, crucially, a business model.

Released to the public at the end of April the existing iPadio iPhone app is simple enough. However, not unlike <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com">BlogTalkRadio</a>, it was based around making a phone call to get your audio online. But the new version of the existing ipadio iPhone app [<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=316553962&#38;mt=8">iTunes link</a>], poised for approval in the App store, brings a ton more functionality to the platform.]]></description>

Did the Internet <em>really</em> need yet another Q&#038;A site, we wondered? </p>
<p>We already have dozens of those, including popular sites like <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/">WikiAnswers.com</a> (not affiliated with the Wikia service but with a terribly confusing name resemblance), <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Answers</a>, <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/answers/">Mahalo Answers</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers">Linkedin Answers</a> (anyone else spotting a naming pattern?) and a plethora of similar services. Wikia thought there was room for one more regardless and was going to try and make a difference by focusing on an open, freely licensed community where copyright remains with the user who submits the content at all times.</p>
<p>And unlike <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/wikia-search">Wikia Search</a>, the startup&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/wikia-search-is-a-complete-letdown/">disappointing attempt</a> at creating a crowd-sourced search engine experience that was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/31/jimmy-wales-deadpools-wikia-search/">shut down</a> by the company a couple of months ago, Wikianswers seems to have gotten a bit of traction with that strategy. Wikia CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/gil-penchina">Gil Penchina</a> tells us Wikianswers recently hit some significant milestones: the site apparently now boasts 200,000 questions of which 50,000 are answered, and it&#8217;s generating a healthy 1 million page views per month. </p>
<p>Granted, this is still a far cry from the traffic some of its more established competitors are seeing - comScore pegs WikiAnswers.com at 79 million monthly page views in the U.S. alone and Yahoo! Answers at 4x that, for example - but Wikia of course only launched its Q&#038;A service about half a year ago. </p>
<p>Much too early to tell if Wikianswers will prove to be a winner for the company, but the current milestones suggest its future may at the very least be a lot brighter than the ill-fated Wikia Search service ever was.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/nnyt-215x67.jpg" width="215" height="67" />Like everyone else I've watched the print media world fall apart over the last few years. The poster child for that industry is the New York Times, of course, and their many missteps in recent memory have been well chronicled. In early 2008 <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> started a New York Times <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/21/news/newsmakers/quittner_andreessen.fortune/index.htm">Deathwatch</a>, and the company's financial performance has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/online-ad-revenues-at-the-new-york-times-keep-dropping-like-a-rock/">degraded</a> since then. 

I keep wondering what would happen if the top 10% of the writers at the NYTimes just...walked out. I know it's crazy, but let's just explore this a bit for the heck of it.

Today the company is worth just a little over $1 billion. As recently as five years ago it was worth nearly 5x that much. You have to go back to the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&#038;chdd=0&#038;chds=0&#038;chdv=0&#038;chvs=maximized&#038;chdeh=0&#038;chdet=1248939684670&#038;chddm=3198380&#038;chls=IntervalBasedLine&#038;q=NYSE:NYT&#038;ntsp=0">early 1980s</a> to see a lower stock price.

I certainly don't think the NYTimes is going to be shutting down any time soon. The company still pulls in nearly $3 billion a year in revenue, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:NYT&#038;fstype=ii">down</a> just 10% or so from 2005. But massive overhead, and more than 9,300 employees, make profitability an increasingly difficult goal for The Gray Lady. Her age is showing.]]></description>

<p><big><strong>Journalism Isn&#8217;t Dead. Just The Old Business Part Of It.</strong></big></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I met the <a href="http://www.politico.com">Politico</a> guys just before they taped their <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10498">Charlie Rose segment</a>. I watched them live from the green room at the show, and read Michael Wolff&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/wolff200908">Vanity Fair article</a> on the young company. Their news room is 100 strong and they have more people in the White House Bureau than any other brand. They have roughly the same traffic as we do - 7 million monthly visitors - but they&#8217;ve been around just half the time. How did they do it? The site was founded by well known political journalists who bailed to start their own company. They <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEaCHocHZRI">took</a> their personal brands and credentials with them, and the readers followed. Today they are profitable - largely because they launched a three-day-a-week <em>print version</em> of the site. Amazing. Print isn&#8217;t dead (yet). Just the overhead is.</p>
<p>And earlier today I got a glimpse at what AOL is up to - they are hiring all the journalists being fired and laid off by the newspapers and magazines. And they now have a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/aol-newsroom-now-has-wow-1500-writers/">news room 1,500 journalists and editors strong</a>. Amazingly, failing old media is throwing away their most valuable assets. And AOL is eagerly picking those assets up for a song. Before anyone knows it, AOL may be the most powerful news outlet in the world.</p>
<p>Journalists still matter. A lot. Especially the good ones.</p>
<p><big><strong>What if&#8230;</strong></big></p>
<p>So that got me thinking about the NYTimes. $3 billion in revenue. 16 million monthly unique visitors and 124 million page views (Comscore worldwide, May 2009). 9,000+ employees. 1,200 news staff, and just 400 or so writers, critics, correspondents and columnists. I&#8217;m still waiting to hear how many editors the paper has on top of those 400, but it&#8217;s probably a total full time news staff of no more than 450 people.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really read the NYTImes beyond the technology section. But I&#8217;m guessing that the top performers in the news room, say the best 5%-10% of the writers and editors, produce 50% or more of the real value of the newspaper. The hungriest reporters. The best writers. The most competitive and aggressive editors.</p>
<p>What if that group, the most valuable assets that the NYTimes controls, simply walked out of the building and started their own company? What would that look like?</p>
<p><big><strong>The New New York Times</strong></big></p>
<p>The New New York Times, or NNYT, would have a writing staff of say 50 people. These are among the best journalists in the world, and lets say they wanted to pay themselves $200,000/year, a top salary for a reporter of that stature. That&#8217;s just $10 million a year in payroll expenses. Call it $12 million with benefits. Plus, they all have stock options in the new comapny</p>
<p>If TechCrunch is any indication, the amount of support staff (developers, office staff, sales people, admin) needed to run the company is at most 20%, or another ten people, particularly if they outsource a lot of that. Put everyone in the cheapest office possible, and you&#8217;re looking at additional payroll, benefits and office expenses of another $3-4 million per year.</p>
<p>Now lets just add another 50% on top of that for other expenses and a safety net, and round it up to $25 million per year in total expenses.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s $25 million/year to have a well paid staff of the best journalists on the planet. How long before they outstrip those 16 million monthly visitors and 124 million page views? 5 years? Less?</p>
<p>How many private equity funds would kill to put $100 million behind the NNYT to make sure the company had plenty of money until it reached profitability?</p>
<p>My guess is plenty. And Marc Andreeseen, who has already <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/marc-andreessens-burgeoning-blogging-empire-invests-in-talking-points-memo/">backed two blogs</a>, may be the first in line to invest. And I know a couple of hedge funds that would be right there, too. I know this because they&#8217;ve pitched me on a vision not much different than this one.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is going to happen. Those 50 top journalists aren&#8217;t going to be able to self select and organize themselves even if they had the inclination to do something like this. But the interesting thing is that I think something like this would work, really work, if anyone tried it. And the guys at Politico and AOL seem to be doing just that. Lean journalism, for the win.</p>

New CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tim-armstrong">Tim Armstrong</a> hasn't been pinned down on how hard he's betting on this strategy in <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/19/tim-armstrongs-prepares-aol-for-a-fragmenting-web/">recent</a> public <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/tim-armstrong-at-fortune-brainstorm-the-future-of-aol/">appearances</a>.

AOL now has 1,500 people writing content across its scores of content sub-brands, we've confirmed. Around 1,000 of those people are working full time for AOL, the rest are freelancing. That's more than double the number that they had creating content a year ago, and by this time next year, we've heard, the plan is to have 2-3x as many people as they do now.

Where is AOL hiring these journalists? From the failing print world. We've obtained a list of hundreds of these individuals, including former journalists at BusinessWeek, New York Times, USA Today, ESPN, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Consumer Reports, Condé Nast and scores of regional and national newspapers and magazines.

A few of them are listed at the end of this report.</p>
<p>From our earlier post describing the media strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the real opportunity for AOL is to grab marketshare in a relatively open field, say some people close to the company. A contingent of AOL executives are said to be pushing Armstrong to embrace what I&#8217;ve heard is called the &#8220;Toyota strategy&#8221; by building and buying scores of great online media brands. AOL is the &#8220;Toyota&#8221; and the media brands are like the many car models that Toyota successfully pushes - Highlander, Camry, Pious, etc. The analogy isn&#8217;t perfect, but it gives you a good idea of how they&#8217;re thinking of organizing things.</p>
<p>The foundation for this strategy is already firmly in place, and has been since <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/05/aol-acquires-weblog-inc/">AOL acquired Weblogs, Inc.</a> in 2005 for $25 million or so (that was three AOL CEO&#8217;s ago, when <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-miller">Jonathan Miller</a> was running things). All those great Weblogs brands have continued to grow at a breakneck pace.  Sites like Engadget, TUAW and Joystiq are all great niche brands on their own. And AOL has expanded into many other sub-brands through their <a href="http://www.mediaglow.com/">MediaGlow</a> division under <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-wilson">Bill Wilson</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/12/aol-continues-to-splinter-content-into-anti-portals/">MediaGlow was unveiled</a> a year ago. These are AOL&#8217;s content sites - music, finance, the blogs, and new sites like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/26/aol-launches-online-news-magazine-politicsdaily/">PoliticsDaily</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/24/aols-secret-lovecom/">Love.com</a>. Combined, these sites bring in 76 million unique monthly visitors (Comsore, May 2009). 27 of the <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> Top 100 blogs are owned by AOL.</p>
<p>The MediaGlow team wants to pick up the pieces of the dying print media business. Advertising is falling off a cliff (billions of dollars in advertising <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/02/from-terrible-to-terrifying-newspaper-ad-sales-plummet-26-billion-in-first-quarter/">has evaporated</a>). Combined with the high structural costs of print media (high wages, and well, printing on paper and mailing to readers) and the result is a lot of high quality talent is suddenly willing to take a job in online, even at a much lower salary.</p>
<p>The plan would be to build and buy scores of new brands in every monetizable niche possible. If you see a magazine at the newsstand covering a topic, AOL will have their own online brand for that topic, in blog or other format. They&#8217;ve already got the publishing platform with MediaGlow. New brands can be inserted or built at little marginal operating cost. And the talent is out there for the taking right now.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update and clarification:</strong> We got the numbers a little wrong yesterday. The total number of full time writers and editors in the AOL newsroom is 500, plus another 1,500 freelancers, for a total of 2,000 full and part time contributors.</p>

Whether it's a sign of economic recovery or just investment bankers getting ready to take off the month of August, there's been a lot acquisition activity lately.  In the last week alone, IBM purchased SPSS for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/monster-merger-ibm-buys-spss-for-approx-12-billion/">$1.2 billion</a>, Amazon bought Zappos for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/">$928 million</a>, Sprint paid <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/sprint-gobbles-up-virgin-mobile-for-483-million/">$483 million</a> for Virgin Mobile, AdKnowledge paid <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/the-value-of-virtual-currency-the-real-price-of-super-rewards-was-closer-to-50-million/">$50 million</a> for Super Rewards, and Yahoo picked up Xoopit for <a href="  http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/why-did-google-let-yahoo-run-off-with-xoopit/">$20 million</a>.

So far in July, the value of the acquisitions we track <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/acquisitions?page=1">on CrunchBase</a> totals $9.6 billion, which is nearly three times more M&#038;A activity than the $2.6 billion we tracked in June.

But the increased deal flow on July suggests that corporate buyers are opening up their purse strings even more while acquisition prices are still relatively cheap.</p>
<p>But the bargains might not last.  Already, the median acquisition price leaped up to $260 million in July, from $22 million in June.  Most of that jump was due to some very big transactions such as the ones listed above, as well as Agilent&#8217;s $1.5 billion purchase of Varian and Bristol-Myers&#8217; $2.1 billion acquisition of Medarex.  Still, you know what they say about rising tides . . . </p>

The change seems to have happened very recently, and reactions are ranging from surprise to anger.

At this point it isn't clear exactly what's going on — it seems like some users may have installed the official Twitter application at some point and not had it post updates until now.  But others are reporting that they've never installed a Twitter-related app, which makes the situation all the more confusing.  We're reaching out to Twitter and Facebook to find out what the cause is.

My hunch is that these users have previously installed the official Twitter app on Facebook, which has had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/twitters-popular-facebook-app-has-been-broken-or-exploited-for-days/">problems</a> in the past, and used it to occasionally check their Twitter profiles without realizing that it was also meant to auto-post their tweets to Facebook (a bug may have prevented these posts from ever actually appearing).  Now Twitter has fixed the bug, and users don't know what's going on.  We'll update as soon we we know the actual cause.]]></description>

<p>At this point it isn&#8217;t clear exactly what&#8217;s going on — it seems like some users may have installed the official Twitter application at some point and not had it post updates until now.  But others are reporting that they&#8217;ve never installed a Twitter-related app, which makes the situation all the more confusing.  We&#8217;re reaching out to Twitter and Facebook to find out what the cause is.</p>
<p>My hunch is that these users have previously installed the official Twitter app on Facebook, which has had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/01/twitters-popular-facebook-app-has-been-broken-or-exploited-for-days/">problems</a> in the past, and used it to occasionally check their Twitter profiles without realizing that it was also meant to auto-post their tweets to Facebook (a bug may have prevented these posts from ever actually appearing). <del datetime="2009-07-30T06:01:54+00:00"> Now Twitter has fixed the bug, and users don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on.  We&#8217;ll update as soon we we know the actual cause.</del> <b>Update:</b> A Facebook bug caused this, see below.</p>
<p>It looks like this may have something to do with Facebook ignoring an application&#8217;s privacy settings.  Under Facebook&#8217;s application privacy page, I&#8217;ve unchecked the box that gives Twitter the ability to post updates to &#8220;Publish recent activity (one line stories) to my wall&#8221;.  However, the updates are still showing up.  We&#8217;re seeing <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/new-twitter-cross-posts-to-facebook-have-users-bewildered/#comment-2889346">similar</a> reports from users with the FriendFeed app installed.</p>
<p><b>Update 2</b>: Facebook has given us the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this evening, a small Facebook bug allowed a handful of apps to publish to the stream on behalf of users who had previously authorized the app. The situation has now been resolved, and all application settings will remain intact for users.

But gamers are still being forced to live with a problem that's troubled the genre since its formation: you can only play along to songs that publishers have approved, licensed, and then 'mapped out' with note charts to play along to.

For those that haven't been exposed to JamLegend before, the site shares a lot of common ground with Guitar Hero.  Gamers load up a song and a flurry of colored dots begin to flow down the screen, with each one corresponding to a differet key on your keyboard.

But gamers are still being forced to live with a problem that&#8217;s troubled the genre since its formation: you can only play along to songs that publishers have approved, licensed, and then &#8216;mapped out&#8217; with note charts to play along to.  Today, they&#8217;re getting a solution: <a href="http://www.jamlegend.com">JamLegend</a>, the Guitar Hero-like <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/28/jamlegend-takes-on-guitar-hero-on-the-web-1000-invites/">website</a> that uses your keyboard instead of a plastic guitar, has launched a new feature that lets you play along to any song in your music collection, whenever you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>For those that haven&#8217;t been exposed to JamLegend before, the site shares a lot of common ground with Guitar Hero.  Gamers load up a song and a flurry of colored dots begin to flow down the screen, with each one corresponding to a differet key on your keyboard.  The experience is less atmospheric than the games you&#8217;ll find on the consoles, largely because it lacks flashy graphics and plastic guitars, but if you&#8217;re a Guitar Hero addict looking to get your fix at the office, it&#8217;s certainly good enough.</p>
<p>Until now JamLegend has fallen prey to the same problem as Guitar Hero and other console games: if a song wasn&#8217;t in the catalog, you couldn&#8217;t play it.  Now, you can upload any song you&#8217;d like, and using digital signal processing, beat detection, and other automatic analysis, JamLegend takes the song and converts it into a playable track within a few minutes.  Of course, generating a playable track is is one thing — but are they any good?</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/alwayswithme.png"/></p>
<p>After trying out a few tracks, I found the technology to work well, though it isn&#8217;t perfect.  On a standard, professionally-made track, you typically play along to guitar notes and not the accompanying drum beats or vocals.  The auto-generated tracks tend to catch the most prominent sound at any point in the track, which means that sometimes you&#8217;ll find yourself playing elements of each instrument, along with the vocals.  This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing, it&#8217;s just a bit different from what you may be used to.</p>
<p>Because this is a fairly unique feature in the genre, JamLegend is hoping to use it to start monetizing the site.  Users can upload up to five of their own tracks at once, and each week they can swap out one of these for a new one (in other words, there&#8217;s a waiting period before you can add new songs).  If you&#8217;d like to have more songs available at once, the site offers an entry-level premium package for $5 a month, which allows for up to 100 tracks at once, or a $20/month package for 500 songs.</p>
<p>All in all this a solid addition, though I&#8217;m curious if the record industry will have a problem with it.  The only way to add a song to your library is to upload your own copy (the site makes it easy to buy songs you don&#8217;t already own, which is another source of revenue), but we&#8217;ve seen the labels get upset over less.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mcnajudge-215x162.png" width="215" height="162" />“<em>You know the beautiful thing: June 29, 2009, is the two- year anniversary of the first shipment of the iPhone,</em>” <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/elevation-partners">Elevation Partners</a> (which owns a huge portion of Palm) co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/roger-mcnamee">Roger McNamee</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#38;sid=a2SkDk7Tu5Mw">told Bloomberg</a> in March. “<em>Not one of those people will still be using an iPhone a month later.</em>”

Yes, that would be today.

So how did McNamee's claim turn out? Well, let's put it this way: If there was a foot-in-the-mouth award given every year, no one else would need to apply this year. Hell, it might take the prize for the whole decade.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88077" title="mcnajudge" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mcnajudge.png" alt="mcnajudge" width="360" height="272" />“<em>You know the beautiful thing: June 29, 2009, is the two- year anniversary of the first shipment of the iPhone,</em>” <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/elevation-partners">Elevation Partners</a> (which owns a huge portion of Palm) co-founder <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/roger-mcnamee">Roger McNamee</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a2SkDk7Tu5Mw">told Bloomberg</a> in March. “<em>Not one of those people will still be using an iPhone a month later.</em>”</p>
<p>Yes, that would be today.</p>
<p>So how did McNamee&#8217;s claim turn out? Well, let&#8217;s put it this way: If there was a foot-in-the-mouth award given every year, no one else would need to apply this year. Hell, it might take the prize for the whole decade. It&#8217;s a quote of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/how-we-know-chrome-os-will-be-a-hit-steve-ballmer-doesnt-think-so/">Ballmer-level proportions</a>.</p>
<p>Before I dive into any kind of analysis, I can say right off the bat that McNamee&#8217;s statement is false. Why? Because I bought the original iPhone on June 29, 2007. I am still using an iPhone today.</p>
<p>Something else to think about: Estimates are that Apple sold somewhere between 250,000 to 500,000 iPhones in its first weekend on sale in 2007. The last <a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2009/06/30/palm-pre-sales-topped-300000-in-june-analyst-says/">estimates</a> given for Pre sales was that it sold around 300,000 by the end of June. It&#8217;s entirely possible that there haven&#8217;t even been as many Pres sold so far as there were iPhones sold during its first weekend. That doesn&#8217;t just make McNamee&#8217;s claim look bad — it makes it impossible.</p>
<p>I do not have a Palm Pre, but I have used one quite a few times now. It&#8217;s a great phone. The hardware isn&#8217;t exactly my cup of tea (I don&#8217;t like the keyboard), but there is no denying that the webOS software is very solid. Of course, it&#8217;s subjective, but I would say the Pre is the second-best smartphone on the market today.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what McNamee said. He said, &#8220;<em>Not one of those people will still be using an iPhone a month later.</em>” The claim was laughable <a href="http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/03/05/palm-investor-puts-his-mouth-where-his-money-is/">at the time</a>, but it&#8217;s even <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/probably-not-the-palm-pre-chart-roger-mcnamee-wants-to-see/">more laughable now</a>. He was, of course, implying that once people who bought the original iPhone saw the Pre, all of them would switch since their initial 2-year contracts would be up.</p>
<p>The reality has been much different. Not only is it likely that many of the people who originally bought the iPhone are still using one, but many of them have upgraded once or twice to newer models. And of course, there are millions more iPhone customers that have been added since then. Including millions since the launch of the iPhone 3GS, which was launched <em>after</em> the Pre.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88087" title="iphonepre" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/iphonepre.png" alt="iphonepre" width="310" height="356" />Speaking of the Pre&#8217;s launch, it took place after McNamee&#8217;s claim, and it sold pretty well out of the gate. But Apple announced the iPhone 3GS a few days later, and as expected, it dampened much of the Pre hype. Sales of the Pre remained decent, but <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/analyst-finds-palm-pre-sales-stabilize-at-ho-hum-levels/">not stellar</a>, and have been slowly trailing off ever since.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the iPhone 3GS that sold over <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/22/apple-touts-1-million-iphone-3g-s-devices-sold-quotes-steve-jobs/">a million units</a> in just three days after its launch, and has remained red hot. It&#8217;s so hot that Apple has had a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/apple-sold-twice-as-many-iphones-as-macs-last-quarter/">hard time</a> keeping it in stock. The Pre, on the other hand, is widely available, according to recent inventory <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/21/probably-not-the-palm-pre-chart-roger-mcnamee-wants-to-see/">checks</a>.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s not entirely fair to compare the two platforms by their app stores, the huge difference cannot be overlooked either. The iPhone launched its App Store a year ago, which was a year after the launch of the first iPhone. So there was already an installed user-base, which is one of the reasons why iPhone app downloads completely <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/a-million-app-downloads-for-palm-a-million-iphone-3gss-for-apple/">destroy</a> Pre app downloads.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the iPhone App Store launched with 500 apps, the Pre&#8217;s App Catalog has an anemic 32 apps, nearly two months after its launch. The number is so laughably low that when two new apps were launched yesterday, it made <a href="http://www.prethinking.com/home/2009/7/29/breaking-news-2-new-apps-on-app-catalog.html">headlines</a> — for the fact that two new apps finally launched.</p>
<p>This is of course because Palm <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/16/palm-opens-the-mojo-sdk-for-all-new-pre-apps-forthcoming/">only just opened its SDK</a> to the public, the lack of which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/18/the-pre-app-catalog-is-tracking-way-way-behind-apples-app-store-and-its-palms-fault/">really hurt</a> its potential. With it out now, the Pre&#8217;s app ecosystem should grow much more quickly, but it will likely still be a few months before we really start to notice that.</p>
<p>But McNamee knew all of that when he made that statement, and yet, he still said it.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s one thing to tout your own product, but calling out a rival with a comment so asinine, was a poor choice, to say the least. And to Palm&#8217;s credit, they knew it too, which is why they <a href="http://www.prethinking.com/home/2009/3/9/10-clarifications-and-corrections-on-what-mcnamee-said-from.html">sent the SEC a filing</a> with 10 clarifications and corrections about what McNamee said in <em>one</em> interview. Here&#8217;s the correction that relates to this:</p>
<blockquote><p>8. The statement in the second paragraph of the article that &#8220;not one&#8221; person who bought an Apple, Inc. iPhone on the first shipment date &#8220;will still be using an iPhone a month&#8221; after the two-year anniversary of that day is an exaggerated prediction of consumer behavior pattern and is withdrawn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, okay, why don&#8217;t we all just make outrageous claims then send the SEC a note to withdraw them? But that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here, to hold people&#8217;s feet to the fire when they say idiotic things, even if they petition the SEC to withdraw them.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the iPhone remains the hottest smartphone and may be the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/the-state-of-the-iphone-is-strong-very-strong/">hottest platform</a> overall on the planet, right now. Apple has sold around 25 million iPhones. Palm has sold something probably south of a half million Pres — it&#8217;s a number that Sprint wouldn&#8217;t even say during its earnings call. And whatever the number was, it was not enough to stop the service from bleeding customers last quarter.</p>
<p>The Pre, while a nice phone, has a number of things working against it, including Sprint&#8217;s smaller network (though I find it to be much better quality-wise than AT&amp;T&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">awful network</a>), and the lack of a robust app ecosystem right now. But both of those should change shortly. I already spoke to the app problem, but Verizon has also announced that the Pre will be on its network sometime in early 2010. That will be big, I imagine.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-88085" title="schiller-palm-wwdc" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/schiller-palm-wwdc.png" alt="schiller-palm-wwdc" width="365" height="259" />But will it be iPhone-killing big? No, of course not. There is plenty of room for many smartphones on the market, you&#8217;d have to imagine that even McNamee knows that. I think his iPhone-envy just got the best of him with such a statement. And that was interesting because it added more fuel to the fire of the Apple/Palm rivalry, which was already an interesting one.</p>
<p>Palm has no shortage of ex-Apple employees now working for it, including newly appointed CEO Jon Rubenstein, who used to head Apple&#8217;s iPod and Mac divisions. And now they&#8217;re caught up with this <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/16/apple-yeah-about-that-palm-pre-itunes-sync-feature/">cat</a>-and-<a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/07/23/palm-releases-webos-110-updated-fixes-itunes-syncing/">mouse</a> game with Apple to make iTunes syncing work for the Pre.</p>
<p>The Pre is also the first mobile device since the iPhone to use multi-touch, something which brought out some interesting statements from Apple about protecting their intellectual property. There have been no lawsuits on that front, but we can probably safely assume that Apple looked into it, and probably isn&#8217;t too happy that it apparently cannot push for legal action.</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/palm-takes-a-bite-out-of-apple-with-full-page-ad-in-the-nyt-2009-6">ad that Sprint made</a> for the Pre, with an eaten apple (which also spoke to the first wave of expiring iPhone contracts). And then there was Apple trash-talking the Pre&#8217;s small app store size during its WWDC keynote. &#8220;<em>And somebody else. I can’t quite read it. It’s small</em>,&#8221; is what Apple&#8217;s Phil Schiller said. (The chart he&#8217;s referring to is above.)</p>
<p>But Apple can talk for now, it has earned that privilege by running laps around its rivals with its smartphone and App Store. Palm, has not. And they look bad today thanks to McNamee.</p>

Yahoo <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=yahoo">dipped</a> 12.08% to $15.14, knocking $2.91 billion off their market cap. Microsoft <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=microsoft">gained</a> 1.41% to $23.80, adding...$2.94 billion to their market cap.

So net/net about $30 million in new value was created today by the market, All of that plus everything Yahoo lost went to Microsoft. Yahoo got Binged, to the tune of $2.9 Billion. <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/2917969732">Oops</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/untitled-4-150x200.png" width="150" height="200" />The <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/best-comment-ever/">outcry</a> over the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">Google Voice ban</a> on the App Store is still going strong, with hundreds of news stories, developer <a href="http://www.riverturn.com/blog/?p=455">posts</a>, and complaints putting the story in and out of Twitter's top trends for nearly three days running.  Much of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">blame</a> has been directed at AT&#038;T, over beliefs that the carrier forced Apple's hand in its decision to ban the applications.  Now it looks like AT&#038;T believes it's been wrongly accused, and it's beginning to take a stand for itself.

Last time we reached out to AT&#038;T to comment on the story, the company gave TechCrunch writer MG Siegler a very blunt and brief statement:


<blockquote>"Nope – Apple is the one who can talk about their App Store."
</blockquote>


But today, the company has begun sending out more detailed messages to some of the frustrated customers who have been voicing their complaints.  The message below was written by Glenn Lurie, AT&#038;T's President of Emerging Devices and Resale.

Now it looks like AT&#038;T believes it&#8217;s been wrongly accused, and it&#8217;s beginning to take a stand for itself.</p>
<p>Last time we reached out to AT&#038;T to comment on the story, the company gave TechCrunch writer MG Siegler a very blunt and brief statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nope – Apple is the one who can talk about their App Store.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>But today, the company has begun sending out more detailed messages to some of the frustrated customers who have been voicing their complaints.  The message below was written by Glenn Lurie, AT&#038;T&#8217;s President of Emerging Devices and Resale.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your letter concerning Apple’s decision on the Google Voice iPhone app was forwarded to me since I work closely with Apple.</p>
<p>While we’re very proud to offer the iPhone 3GS along with the thousands of apps available through the App Store, AT&#038;T does not manage the App Store – and we are not involved in the approval process for apps in the App Store.  I recommend in this particular case that you express your concerns to Apple.</p>
<p>I’m glad you’re enjoying your iPhone and hope that you continue to be an AT&#038;T customer.  We appreciate and value your business.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Glenn Lurie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AT&#038;T&#8217;s stance is no longer that it can&#8217;t talk about the App Store — it&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t <i>manage</i> the App Store, and that any concerns about this case should be directed at Apple.  Of course, the note leaves plenty of wiggle room for AT&#038;T.  The company may not be necessarily &#8220;managing&#8221; the approval process, but it could easily be the whispering in the ears of the people who do.  And to say that AT&#038;T isn&#8217;t involved at all seems highly unlikely as well — why would Apple cripple apps like Sling were it not over bandwidth concerns voiced by AT&#038;T?  Still, there must be some reason why AT&#038;T is beginning to change its tune.  AT&#038;T would be foolish to paint a bulls-eye on Apple as it tries to extend its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/shocker-att-wants-to-keep-keep-sitting-on-its-golden-egg-the-iphone/">incredibly valuable</a> exclusive iPhone contract, but it&#8217;s doing what it can to deflect a few of the blows coming from its frustrated customers.</p>
<p>We followed up on the letter above by getting in touch with AT&#038;T, at which point an AT&#038;T spokesman said that the company stood by what Lurie had written and that we should contact Apple for any further information.  Apple spokesman Steve Dowling refused to comment on the matter.  Our brief conversation, which consisted largely of &#8220;we haven&#8217;t made any comment on that&#8221; responses, included this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>JK: Are you planning to comment?<br />
SD: We haven&#8217;t made any comment on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where does the blame truly lie? It&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll ever get a straight answer.  <a href="http://www.daringfireball.com">Daring Fireball&#8217;s</a> John Gruber has <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/google_voice#update-13:40">cited</a> a reliable source in saying that it was &#8220;AT&#038;T that objected to Google Voice apps for the iPhone. It’s that simple.&#8221;  And I myself <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">suspect</a> that the blame lies largely with AT&#038;T.  But others, like <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">Om Malik</a>, believe that Apple should be bearing the brunt of the blame.</p>
<p>But in the end, users don&#8217;t really care who is to blame, provided the issue gets resolved quickly.  If that doesn&#8217;t happen, developers will continue to lose faith in the  App Store&#8217;s <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/15/the-new-apple-walled-garden/">walled garden</a> approach.  Apple will lose its glossy luster, and some will seek lusher platforms where they&#8217;re sure they can actually release the applications they&#8217;ve spent months building.  The iPhone may be dominating this space now, but we&#8217;re really only about two years into this new era of smart phones — it&#8217;s a bit early for Apple to be embittering developers with such regularity.</p>

<p>Today, Yahoo died as a search engine.  If the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-the-most-important-facts-and-some-opinion/">deal with Microsoft</a> is approved, what will replace it will be <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>, the search engine that Microsoft <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/apparently-bing-is-something-of-a-hit/">launched</a> only two months ago.  Within a few months time, Microsoft will go from owning 8 percent of the U.S. search market to 28 percent (comScore). That is still less than half of Google&#8217;s 65 percent, but it could give Microsoft a fighting chance in the search wars against Google.</p>
<p>While the agreement was a long time coming, Bing was the cherry on top, so to speak.  Earlier today, I spoke with the two executives who oversaw the negotiations for both sides, Yahoo EVP <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/hilary-schneider">Hillary Schneider</a> and Microsoft SVP <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/yusuf-mehdi">Yusuf Mehdi</a>.  I asked how big an impact Bing&#8217;s sudden success had on bringing the deal to a close. &#8220;Seeing Bing as a live experience was a nice assurance,&#8221; says Schneider, &#8220;but did not change our rationale or timing.  This was a conversation that went on over several months.  Bing was introduced after we had material momentum in how we wanted to approach this partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Bing was able to gain market share in its very first month, and it <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/bing-gains-some-search-share-from-yahoo/">took it from Yahoo</a>, not Google. And Bing is just going to get better. Yahoo faced the very real prospect of market share erosion from below as well as from above.  Now in one fell swoop, Microsoft will control all of Yahoo&#8217;s search volume. In a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/bartz-on-bing-seearch-deal-everyone-wants-a-real-alternative-live-notes/">conference call today</a>, Steve Ballmer explained how important market share is in search:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do we think we will have better algorithms for relevance?  Yes we do. There is a feedback loop in search. the more searches you serve, the more you learn about what people click on. Scale drives knowledge.  There is a return to scale from seeing that much activity [that is more] than Yahoo or MSFT see independently</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft will measure the success of this deal in two ways: increased market share with advertisers and increased market share with consumers.  When I asked Mehdi what success would look like a couple years out, he defines it in terms of &#8220;shares of queries and spends.&#8221;  Even before mentioning gaining share with consumers, he says: &#8220;Success is a smooth transition for advertisers as they shift more share of wallet from traditional media and competitors to get the better ROI.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Microsoft will also become the new home for Yahoo&#8217;s search technologies.  That is a good thing because even before this deal was announced, the spirit of technology innovation at Yahoo which produced  projects such as Yahoo Boss and Search Monkey seems to have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/19/yahoo-search-as-we-know-it-is-over/">fizzled</a>.  These efforts will now be passed on to Microsoft.  The fortunate news is that Mehdi says he wants to keep those projects alive.  &#8220;For Search Monkey and Boss, we will integrate that technology and determine how to take that forward.  There is a lot of goodness there.&#8221;  At least Microsoft knows a good developer platform when it sees one.</p>
<p>So the deal is good for Microsoft.  It puts them in the game, and they didn&#8217;t even have to pay $1 billion upfront.  But is it good for Yahoo?  </p>
<p>Instead of that upfront payment, Yahoo is getting 88 percent of search advertising revenues on Yahoo-owned sites every year for the next five years (at which point the so-called TAC rate will be renegotiated for the last five years of the deal).  &#8220;This is a materially higher TAC than any of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/14/hey-microsoft-how-bout-we-do-that-first-deal-you-offered/">previous arrangements</a>,&#8221; says Schneider.  But it&#8217;s also not much higher than what big affiliates like AOL are believed to be getting from Google today.  And Yahoo needs to keep paying its sales force, but can only keep 88 percent of the revenues they generate.  (Although there are some revenue-per-search guarantees baked into the deal to protect Yahoo on the downside).</p>
<p>Investors <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/wall-streets-reaction-to-the-microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-not-good/">aren&#8217;t thrilled</a> with the deal, and it is not just because they tend to value cash over potential.  This is a ten-year arrangement between two lumbering giants that is filled with execution risk.  It is a very complicated deal.  Yahoo&#8217;s sales team has enough trouble communicating with its own engineers.  Now they have to learn how to talk to Microsoft&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis argues that Yahoo just <a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/07/29/yahoo-committed-seppuku-today/">committed suicide</a>, while Bill Gurley thinks the opposite, that Yahoo had to <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2009/07/29/counter-point-to-calacanis-on-yahoo-microsoft-deal/">get out of Google&#8217;s way</a> to survive.</p>
<p>The two companies will work hard to pull this off.  Their futures depend on it.  And the deal is structured in a way that makes sure both sides make more money the more searches and advertising dollars Bing generates.  Getting to that ideal state, though, won&#8217;t be easy.  In the meantime, as they work through all of the implementation issues, Google could strengthen its position and take even more share. </p>
<p>No matter what happens, Yahoo just took itself out of the search game.  It got Binged. </p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-87977" title="the-hangover-01" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/the-hangover-01.jpg" alt="the-hangover-01" width="334" height="222" />Time Warner released it<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Time-Warner-Inc-Reports-bw-4243096883.html?x=0&amp;.v=1"> second quarter results</a> today, and the numbers aren&#8217;t good. Overall, revenue was down 9% versus the year-ago period as poor results from the publishing, film and yes, AOL dragged down the numbers for all. CEO <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-bewkes">Jeff Bewkes</a> remarks are telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, we’re continuing the reshaping of Time Warner that we started last year. We’re on track to spin off AOL to our stockholders around the end of the year. Separating AOL will benefit both companies – enabling Time Warner to concentrate fully on our core content businesses and improving AOL’s operational and strategic flexibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s three AOL mentions in three sentences. Clearly, Time Warner is happy to let everyone know that it will only have a couple more quarters of dealing with that division&#8217;s nosedive.</p>
<p>How bad was AOL this quarter? Revenues dropped 24%, to $804 million, versus the year-ago period. The service saw a 21% decrease in advertising revenues, attributable to both display and search ads on its own sites, as well as on third-party sites using its platform.</p>
<p>And the loss of dial-up subscribers continues to hurt the company. It lost over a half million in this past quarter, and some 2.3 million from the year-ago period. Revenues from subscriptions declined 27% from the year-ago period.</p>
<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/time-warner-to-decide-on-aol-spinoff-at-thursday-board-meeting-its-a-done-deal/">AOL spin-off</a>, Google recently sold back its 5% stake in the company, at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/google-sells-back-its-stake-in-aol-there-goes-700-million/">a $700 million discount</a> from its initial $1 billion investment. However, thanks to the search deal over these past several years, it looks as if Google was much closer to break-even on the deal.</p>
<p>And while AOL&#8217;s numbers were awful, Time Warner&#8217;s print and film divisions hardly fared better. The print division headed up by Time, saw a 26% decrease in ad revenue from the year-ago period, and an 18% decrease in subscription revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the film division was hurt by the slide in DVD sales. While movies like <em>The Hangover</em> exceeded expectations at the box office, those profits were wiped out by DVD numbers being down across the board.</p>
<p>Highlighting <em>The Hangover</em> in the results is interesting. One could say Time Warner&#8217;s experience with AOL these past several years after the $164 billion mega (or perhaps &#8220;drunken&#8221;) merger in 2001 (remember, it was AOL that actually bought Time Warner at the time), has been similar to <em>The Hangover</em>. Based on the repurchasing price Time Warner paid for Google&#8217;s AOL stock, AOL is now worth less than $6 billion.</p>

Carol Bartz and Steve Ballmer are all smiles this morning with the signing of their long-awaited <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-the-most-important-facts-and-some-opinion/">search deal,</a> but the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/bartz-on-bing-seearch-deal-everyone-wants-a-real-alternative-live-notes/">agreement</a> isn't going over so well on Wall Street.

Investors who were hoping for a large upfront payment and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/bartz-wants-to-buy-social-and-video-startups-would-sell-yahoo-for-boatloads-of-money/">"boatloads of money"</a> were disappointed by the terms of the deal, which includes no upfront payment.  But that is short-sighted of investors because the actual deal ends up giving Yahoo a much bigger share of search revenues (88 percent) than the previous deal that was on the table last year.

<p>Carol Bartz and Steve Ballmer are all smiles this morning with the signing of their long-awaited <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/microsoft-yahoo-search-deal-the-most-important-facts-and-some-opinion/">search deal,</a> but the <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/bartz-on-bing-seearch-deal-everyone-wants-a-real-alternative-live-notes/">agreement</a> isn&#8217;t going over so well on Wall Street.  Shares of Yahoo took a plunge this morning on the announcement and are <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=yhoo">currently trading</a> at $15.31, down 11 percent from yesterday&#8217;s close.  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=msft&#038;.yficrumb=FOQArQWgPuY">Microsoft shares</a> are flat.</p>
<p>Investors who were hoping for a large upfront payment and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/27/bartz-wants-to-buy-social-and-video-startups-would-sell-yahoo-for-boatloads-of-money/">&#8220;boatloads of money&#8221;</a> were disappointed by the terms of the deal, which includes no upfront payment.  But that is short-sighted of investors because the actual deal ends up giving Yahoo a much bigger share of search revenues (88 percent) than the previous deal that was on the table last year.  It is actually a much better deal for Yahoo long-term if it works, and aligns its incentives closer to Microsoft&#8217;s.  </p>
<p>If Yahoo were instead to realize more of the value of the deal upfront, it wouldn&#8217;t have as much reason to make the deal a success over time.  This is a10-year deal.  Making sure both sides are working towards the same goals for the next decade is pretty crucial, and a large upfront payment would have diminished that incentive because it would have come with a lower revenue-share for Yahoo on the backend.  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said as much on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/bartz-on-bing-seearch-deal-everyone-wants-a-real-alternative-live-notes/">conference call</a> this morning when asked what the differnce was between this deal and the one offered last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>The deal last year was tailored more towards an investor than an operator. This deal is different, not better. Less upfront payment, and definitely a higher TAC rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>(The TAC (traffic acquisitions cost) rate is the percentage of search ad revenues Yahoo gets from the deal).  Whether or not Bartz had a choice in the matter, taking the higher TAC rate over a &#8220;boatload of cash&#8221; will be better for Yahoo in the long run.  Eventually, Yahoo&#8217;s investors will figure that out.</p>

Coupon site <a href=" http://www.savings.com/">Savings.com</a> just got a redesign and a new board member: Mahalo CEO (and TechCrunch50 co-host) <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jason-calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a>.  "They've broken $10 million in revenue after just a couple of years," says Calacanis, "and are crushing it in the deals space. Obviously this is a great place to be in a recession."

The redesign is aimed at making the site more social for those virtual coupon clippers (hey, don't laugh, we should all be trying to save more money these days) who want to just live to tell everyone they know about the great deals they found.

The site offers coupons from about 2,000 merchants, including the Gap, Restoration Hardware, and even the San Diego Zoo.  The site is basically a coupon search engine, organized by brands, stores, and shopping categories. The new design is much more social—as far as a coupon site can be social.  Each deal can be voted up, commenetd on, or shared (via Twitter, Facebook, Digg, reddit, delicious, or email).  And members can submit their own deals.  ]]></description>

<p>There are <a href=" http://www.crunchbase.com/tag/coupons">tons of coupon sites</a> out there, such as <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a> and <a href="http://www.couponchief.com/">CouponChief</a>.  CEO Loren Bendele says he is trying to stand out from the crowd by creating a good user experience so that peopel stick around and want to come back instead of just keeping up bad deals or expired coupons which draw SEO traffic but little else.  </p>
<p>Bendele expects to pull in more than $10 million in revenues this year and drive more than $200 million in sales for participating merchants.  That is not a bad little business.  (The company has raised $6 million in ventiure capital, most recently in October, 2008 from US Venture Partners.  </p>

You arrive at your new dorm room and, after a few moments of excitement, come to the unsettling conclusion that you have either A) brought so much junk that your room will soon resemble a rummage sale or B) brought so little that even <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0712/y_walker08.html">Steve Jobs</a> would be uncomfortable in your spartan abode.  Not exactly the best way to kick off your college career.</p>
<p>A new startup called <a href="http://www.DesignYourDorm.com">DesignYourDorm</a> might just hold the answer.  The site has built 3D virtual models of common dorm room layouts, allowing new students to figure out what they&#8217;ll have room for long before they ever set foot in their dorms.  To help figure out the exact room configuration, DesignYourDorm currently has a few hundred 3D models of various common dorm room items, including electronics like TV sets, furniture like beds and desks, and storage containers that you can freely drag and drop into the room.  There&#8217;s also a selection of bedding, posters, and plenty of things that you might find at Bed Bath &#038; Beyond.  And because most people wind up rooming with someone, the site has a collaboration feature that lets two roommates edit their room at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course, virtual decorating is one thing, but that still leaves students with the task of actually going out and <i>buying</i> each item they place.  But DesignYourDorm has that figured out too: each of the items you can place in your room is a real product taken from Amazon.com, and the site builds a virtual shopping cart as you go.  When you&#8217;re done, you can have everything shipped to your university so it&#8217;s there the day you arrive.  DesignYourDorm generates revenue through Amazon&#8217;s affiliate program, but it eventually hopes to work with big-box stores instead.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/roomshot1.png"/></p>
<p>But the system comes with a few snags.  While the site does a good job with its generic floor plans, they only get you so far — you still won&#8217;t know how large each cabinet and desk will be, the height of the beds, placement of any windows, and so on. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the startup is hoping to team up with universities across the country to get detailed floor plans for <i>every single room</i> at a given school.  It&#8217;s currently running a <a href="http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2009/07/09/News/Design.Your.Dorm.Room.Online-3751095.shtml">pilot test</a> with the University of Pennsylvania, where it has taken measurements for all room layouts in one of the school&#8217;s housing buildings.  As part of the partnership, Penn will be promoting the site to incoming students as they get their room assignments, and will in turn get a small cut of the revenue generated by any sales.  Interesting sidenote: the startup has a mirrored domain at <a href="http://www.CollegeRoomCreator.com">CollegeRoomCreator.com</a> for its university partnerships, because schools apparently don&#8217;t like referring to their housing facilities as &#8220;dorms&#8221;.  Seriously.</p>
<p>All in all, the site seems to have a solid idea and a large market.  That said, it still needs to work on its execution.  The site&#8217;s UI is clunky at times, and sometimes the 3D objects don&#8217;t behave as you&#8217;d expect (I&#8217;m allowed to place a small storage container on top of a bed but not beneath it, even though it explicitly says that it&#8217;s meant to fit underneath beds).  Likewise, many of the site&#8217;s products don&#8217;t yet have 3D models, which means you can buy them but can&#8217;t place them into the room at all.  Co-founder Taylor Robinson  says that the company is working on fixing all of these issues (it recently hired a new developer), and that we can expect improvements soon.</p>

Most of the public Internet companies have reported their second quarter earnings by now.  In a research note sent out to clients today, J.P. Morgan provides a few takeaways from the quarter.  We already know that the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">recession continues</a> in overall online advertising (see chart), but even normally-strong search revenue was down.  And display advertising shows "no signs of recovery."  Travel, finance, and entertainment remain especially weak advertising sectors.

But even in a down market there can be winners.  Both Google and Amazon gained share in search and e-commerce revenues, respectively.  Google now commands 72.3 percent of all search <em>revenues</em>, according to J.P. Morgan. Online travel sites are also benefiting from the weak economy, with hotels giving them more inventory.

<p>Most of the public Internet companies have reported their second quarter earnings by now.  In a research note sent out to clients today, J.P. Morgan provides a few takeaways from the quarter.  We already know that the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/the-online-ad-recession-continues-is-this-what-a-reset-looks-like/">recession continues</a> in overall online advertising (see our chart at right), but even normally-strong search revenue was down.  And display advertising shows &#8220;no signs of recovery.&#8221;  Travel, finance, and entertainment remain especially weak advertising sectors.</p>
<p>But even in a down market there can be winners.  Both Google and Amazon gained share in search and e-commerce revenues, respectively.  Google now commands 72.3 percent of all search <em>revenues</em>, according to J.P. Morgan. Online travel sites are also benefiting from the weak economy, with hotels giving them more inventory.</p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways from the note:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Search revenue was down Y/Y for the first time. We estimate that domestic search rev was down ~2% Y/Y during 2Q as we believe Google’s and Microsoft’s gross search revenues were roughly flat, while we estimate Yahoo!’s gross search revenue was down ~10%.</em></li>
<li><em>Google continues to gain search dollar market share. Despite the launch of Bing, search dollar market share shifts in favor of Google have continued. We estimate that the 2Q’09 gross dollar market share of Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft came in at 72.3%, 20.9%, and 6.8% vs. 2Q’08 levels of 70.6%, 22.7%, and 6.6%.</em></li>
<li><em>Display advertising is showing no signs of recovery. Yahoo’s display revenue was down 14% Y/Y in the quarter on top of 1Q’s 13% decline. The declines at Microsoft and AOL were significant</em></li>
<li><em>Online travel agents are likely benefiting from increased inventory. Industry sources point to hotel suppliers both domestic and abroad giving more inventory to online travel agents in an effort to increase volume. This quarter, Expedia showed a 26% Y/Y lift in room nights sold, a significant increase from 1Q’s 13% growth.<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Amazon still gaining market share. 2Q saw Amazon (North America rev. +13% Y/Y) continue to take share from eBay (US non-vehicles GMV -8%), though the ~2,150 bps difference in growth rates was down from ~3,240 bps in 1Q.</em></li>

<p>The Reader team notes today that it has <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/08/pubsubhubbub-support-for-reader-shared.html">begun the adoptio</a>n of PubSubHubbub, starting with the publishing of Shared Items. As you can see in the demo video below, with PubSubHubbub support, when you share an item in Google Reader, it instantaneously shows up on services like <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> (which pull in Reader Shared Items).</p>
<p>While this is just for Shared Items right now, you can imagine that Google Reader will add further support as well in time. It really needs to in order to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/15/google-reader-takes-another-social-step-with-people-search-and-likes/">keep up with the speed</a> at which information is traveling around the web on sites like Twitter, Facebook and FriendFeed.</p>
<p>And while this is a side project by some Google employees (PubSubHubbub) working on a Google application (Google Reader) and shown off on a service started by a bunch of ex-Googlers (FriendFeed), the main idea behind PubSubHubbub goes far beyond that. They want the fully open protocol to be used by all services/sites that work with feed items to make them more real-time. As one of the creators, Brad Fitzpatrick said during our event, &#8220;<em>Nothing in the protocol hardcodes Google as the center of the world, I hate that sort of crap too.</em>&#8221;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/stream2-215x184.png" width="215" height="184" />This afternoon Facebook's Open Stream API, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/facebook-opens-up-its-stream-api-to-developers/">launched</a> in late April, will be getting a few new additions that make the API significantly more robust and easier for developers to integrate. 

One feature that will be familiar to Twitter and FriendFeed users is a new 'via' attribution, pointing out to your friends how you submitted your latest update.  This can add to the virality of applications like <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> and web services like <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> — if you start seeing that many of your friends are using a certain app, you're probably more likely to check it out for yourself.   Before now Facebook had shown the <i>icon</i> of whatever application or site was posting to your profile, but it didn't actually name it.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/stream2.png" class="shot2"/>This afternoon Facebook&#8217;s Open Stream API, which <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/facebook-opens-up-its-stream-api-to-developers/">launched</a> in late April, will be getting a few new additions that make the API significantly more robust and easier for developers to integrate. </p>
<p>One feature that will be familiar to Twitter and FriendFeed users is a new &#8216;via&#8217; attribution, pointing out to your friends how you submitted your latest update.  This can add to the virality of applications like <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> and web services like <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> — if you start seeing that many of your friends are using a certain app, you&#8217;re probably more likely to check it out for yourself.   Before now Facebook had shown the <i>icon</i> of whatever application or site was posting to your profile, but it didn&#8217;t actually name it.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/viafb.png"/><br />
</center></p>
<p>Another major addition to the API is enhanced functionality for Facebook Pages.  Page administrators will now be able to post updates to their Page from third party applications that support the Open Stream API. Before now there were some loopholes that allowed developers to integrate support for Pages, but the API didn&#8217;t officially support it.  Now, these features are fully baked in.</p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s a new JavaScript version of Facebook&#8217;s stream.publish function.  Many sites have already been using Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;Share&#8217; feature for some time, which allows you to post a given webpage to your Facebook feed (it&#8217;s also extremely easy to integrate).  But using Share, developers haven&#8217;t been able to specify what those posted stories should actually display — Facebook just scrapes the page for its title and a brief description.  Using stream.publish, developers can customize these shared items as they&#8217;d like, including messages like &#8220;Jason just wrote this comment on TechCrunch&#8221; or &#8220;Michael just purchased tickets to Hawaii on Orbitz&#8221;.  Stream.publish has been around since the API launched in April, but now that it&#8217;s available as a JavaScript function it will be very easy for developers to implement.</p>

This could potentially be the last Leopard update we see before Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) is released to the public sometime in the next couple of months.

Amazon already has Snow Leopard available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mac-version-10-6-Snow-Leopard/dp/B001AMHWP8">pre-order</a>, with a ship date expected sometime in September, though it warns that date is not set in stone: "<em>Official release date has not been announced by Apple, though they have indicated this product will be released sometime in September.</em>"

The new OS seems to be getting more buzz for its price (29.99) than its features. The emphasis with Snow Leopard is optimizing Leopard, to make OS X run smoother and faster. Remarkably, it will also have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/os-x-snow-leopard-should-purr-along-with-a-smaller-footprint/">a smaller footprint</a> than its predecessor, saving over 6 GB of hard disk space (though that does likely have a lot to do with the fact that it will only run on Intel processors).]]></description>

<p>The new OS seems to be getting more buzz for its price (29.99) than its features. The emphasis with Snow Leopard is optimizing Leopard, to make OS X run smoother and faster. Remarkably, it will also have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/08/os-x-snow-leopard-should-purr-along-with-a-smaller-footprint/">a smaller footprint</a> than its predecessor, saving over 6 GB of hard disk space (though that does likely have a lot to do with the fact that it will only run on Intel processors).</p>
<p>Snow Leopard will of course also be coming out around the same time as Windows 7, Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to make its users forget Vista. Windows 7 will be out October 22.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 10.5.8? Nothing too exciting on the face of it, here&#8217;s a list of <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3606">highlights</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrades Safari to version 4.0.2.</li>
<li>Improves the accuracy of full history search in Safari 4.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue in which certain resolutions might not appear in the Display pane in System Preferences.</li>
<li>Dragging an Aperture image into Automator now invokes an Aperture action instead of incorrectly invoking an iPhoto action.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue that could prevent importing of large photo and movie files from digital cameras.</li>
<li>Improves overall Bluetooth reliability with external devices, USB webcams and printers.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue that could cause extended startup times.</li>
<li>Improves iCal reliability with MobileMe Sync and CalDav.</li>
<li>Addresses data reliability issues with iDisk and MobileMe.</li>
<li>Improves overall reliability with AFP.</li>
<li>Improves overall reliability with Managed Client.</li>
<li>Improves compatibility and reliability for joining AirPort networks.</li>
<li>Improves Sync Service reliability.</li>
<li>Includes additional RAW image support for several third-party cameras.</li>
<li>Improves compatibility with some external USB hard drives.</li>
<li>Includes latest security fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The following two charts comparing the Windows 7 upgrade path to the OS X Snow Leopard upgrade path are pretty hilarious [via <a href="http://www.marco.org/156608888">Marco.org</a> and <a href="http://tumbl.strelau.net/post/156605288/upgrading-to-os-x-snow-leopard-inspired-by-the">(ds)</a>]:</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spotified-215x143.jpg" width="215" height="143" />Last month at <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/announcing-the-europas-the-techcrunch-europe-awards-2009/">The Europas</a> - TechCrunch Europe’s version of the Crunchies - a lot of impressive start-ups were honored. But one was clearly cleaning up: <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, the sexy online music app that has music lovers in Europe swooning.

Each time the company won, you heard two reactions from the crowd: fan boys screaming with joy and other companies’ founders groaning. “Too big for their boots,” was a phrase heard muttered a lot.

But player hating is just part of life as a hot start-up right? Of course - but Spotify is living in a particular dual reality. It’s caught between the rapture of music lovers who say it’s the site they always dreamed could exist and the cruel reality of the online music business.

And that meant there was a lot more drama than immediately meets the eye behind that <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d890cbea-8066-11de-bf04-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1">reported</a> $50 million funding and $250 million valuation. As one investor who ultimately passed on the deal told us, “This was one of those where you hold your nose and just pay up. Before you’ve done anything the majority of the economics are right out the door to the labels. You need huge scale to pay for all that, and then you’re still in bed with a bunch of numb nuts.”

Someone in the comments of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/spotify-closing-new-financing-at-e200-million-valuation-music-labels-already-shareholders/">our previous Spotify story</a> said it was Europe’s YouTube. We don’t know if they meant that in a good way or a bad way—but we agree on both. The problem with the comparison? YouTube found Google; a deep-pocketed public company that was also trying to build a video offering online and was willing to pay top dollar for YouTube’s streams, and their associated business model challenges.

Several VCs we talked to used the words “leap of faith” over-and-over again in describing the decision to invest in Spotify or not. In reality an investor has to make multiple leaps of faith to do this deal, especially at a $250 million valuation. Looking at those leaps explains why so many VCs who were awed by the product ultimately passed - and yet why a few ballsy investors saw the elusive upside worth the role of the dice.]]></description>

We don’t know if they meant that in a good way or a bad way—but we agree on both. The problem with the comparison? YouTube found Google; a deep-pocketed public company that was also trying to build a video offering online and was willing to pay top dollar for YouTube’s streams, and their associated business model challenges.</p>
<p>Several VCs we talked to used the words “leap of faith” over-and-over again in describing the decision to invest in Spotify or not. In reality an investor has to take multiple leaps of faith to do this deal, especially at a $250 million valuation. Looking at those leaps explains why so many VCs who were awed by the product ultimately passed - and yet why a few ballsy investors saw the elusive upside worth the role of the dice.<br />
<strong><br />
Leap of Faith #1: The Labels Want an Apple Alternative.</strong> This seems like common sense, right? But how often do music labels act according to common sense? There’s a whole Internet graveyard full of online music start-ups that VCs invested $20 million or more in, cut deals with labels and the labels happily sucked them dry. It’s a good sign that the labels have been taking equity investments in Spotify, but that hardly makes it certain they’ll support the company. It’s common for big public companies to invest an immaterial amount in a promising start-up in order to keep a close eye on it.</p>
<p>According to people close to the company, the deals being negotiated with labels are similar to past subscription deals. There’s a minimum in royalties that has to be paid, and once that’s cleared there’s a more reasonable revenue share. But that minimum bar is so high, that’s where most subscription services have died. “The labels are entertaining how to work with them in a way everyone can make money, but they’re still clearly taking a pound of flesh,” said one person with knowledge of the negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of Faith #2: Audio Advertising Will Shift from Radio to Online.</strong> So far, the money Spotify is getting from audio ads is likely to be &#8220;chump change - less than you could earn from those crappy ads at the bottom of instant messenger clients,&#8221; according to one industry expert we talked to. For the service to still have a free element, a larger-than-just-Spotify industry shift is going to have to occur where audio ads move from terrestrial radio to the Web in material amounts. We’re knee-deep in that shift in print, and only beginning to see it in online video. Will it happen in audio? Probably, but not next year.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of Faith #3: Millions Will Pay for Subscriptions.</strong> That means the real opportunity for Spotify to build a business is the subscription model - something no online music company has succeeded at to date. Right now the company claims it has &#8220;just under 100,000 users&#8221; paying $10 a month. Other sources confirm that it’s growing at a fast clip. While impressive, the onerous costs from the labels mean that revenue - $12m a year, before that &#8220;crappy&#8221; audio ad money -  is not nearly enough. For this business to work Spotify needs millions of paying subscribers.</p>
<p>The fact is, Spotify is not only trying to break the online music subscription curse, they’re trying to do something few have done on the Web. To date people have shown themselves unwilling to pay for content and premium services en masse. Even the mighty Netflix only has 10 million subscribers; Match.com has less than 1 million. And again, thanks to the pressures from the labels, Spotify doesn’t have years to get there.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of Faith #4: Apple Won’t Kick Spotify Off the iPhone; Other Mobile Carriers Will Champion it as an iTunes Alternative.</strong> <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/27/apple-is-growing-rotten-to-the-core-and-its-likely-atts-fault/">Apple isn’t open</a>. It’s territorial. And with good reason—it owns the dominant mobile Web and music platforms. Why on earth would it allow Spotify&#8217;s offline music player app to compete on its own hardware with iTunes?</p>
<p>That leaves other mobile devices to champion Spotify as an iTunes/iPhone alternative. That strikes us as highly likely. What’s more: People are more willing to pay $10 a month for a music app that’s not tethered to their computers. This would seem to be the company’s best bet to solve its business model woes and get enough future investment to hit scale.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of Faith #5: US Launch Goes Well.</strong> Spotify is saying it will launch in the US by early 2010. That doesn’t seem feasible, given their business model challenges and the fact that this round was only 50 million. Investors who looked at the deal confirmed they’d need a much larger war chest to make that happen. Also, there is some confusion over whether the round is even closed at all - with some close to the company saying it&#8217;s still open but the company itself saying it has been closed for two weeks.</p>
<p>Much seems to depend on just how much demand there is to invest in Spotify, which is hard to read. The company claims that it got nine term sheets and a 20% premium on what we understand was a requested €150 million valuation. The latter appears to be true, but we know that the bulk of the major European VCs—including names like Balderton and Index that don’t normally balk at price if a company is good enough—turned down Spotify or offered a term sheet at a substantially lower valuation, due to all these leaps of faith. And, we contacted six of the top US consumer Internet partners who said they weren’t even pitched. This leaves us wondering from where these nine competitive term sheets came. In addition, the deal took a reported five months to close&#8211; unusual for a &#8220;hot&#8221; company.</p>
<p>There are certainly billions in cash in the world of private equity for promising companies, even in this economy. But it’s unclear how much more there is for Spotify while all these questions remain.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of Faith #6: If All the Above Fails, Someone Buys the Company for  $100 Million. </strong>In other words, what are the odds the incoming investors<em> lose </em>money? We think chances are good they’ll at least make their money back. After all no one disputes the beauty of the product or how many people love it. That’s clearly worth something even in a worst-case, fire-sale acquisition. Any investor worth their salt would have insisted on a liquidation preference given the risks and the high valuation attached to the deal.</p>
<p>It bears noting that while Spotify has been wildly promoting themselves in off-the-record conversations with the press (including us) they have been less than forthcoming with information publicly. In several weeks of reporting this story in the Valley and in London, we talked to more than a dozen people including investors who looked at the deal, people close to the company and other people in the online music industry. We’ve found a host of troubling contradictions that we tried to comb through for this story, with little help from Spotify.</p>
<p>We sent two emails to the company detailing the discrepancies we were hearing on both sides of the pond and got little back but a note saying the founders “wouldn’t comment on financial matters” and “didn’t like (our) tone.” This after their representatives had been providing us, off the record, with hype about subscription numbers and claims about term sheets and increased valuations.</p>
<p>Given the mass of uncertainties in the business and how many users love the service, it’d be nice to see the company be a bit more forthcoming about its future.</p>

Some hailed it as the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/04/the-inevitable-march-of-recorded-music-towards-free/">future of music distribution</a>, others thought it would be a total failure. In reality, it wasn't really either. While the album found huge success (it was also released in the traditional way later), Radiohead waffled on the idea of using such a distribution method in the future. But today they're back online with a new single.

"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" is available today on the band's <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/">website</a>. But there's a difference between it and <em>In Rainbows</em> — it has a set price. £1.00 (or roughly $1.70) gets you the single in high-quality MP3 format. But don't mistake this for Radiohead completely abandoning some of its online experimentation ideas, this single has a price primarily because its proceeds are going to the Royal British Legion.]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Harry Patch (In Memory Of)&#8221; is available today on the band&#8217;s <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/">website</a>. But there&#8217;s a difference between it and <em>In Rainbows</em> — it has a set price. £1.00 (or roughly $1.70) gets you the single in high-quality MP3 format. But don&#8217;t mistake this for Radiohead completely abandoning some of its online experimentation ideas, this single has a price primarily because its proceeds are going to the Royal British Legion.</p>
<p>You see, Harry Patch was the name the last remaining UK World War I veteran before he passed away recently at the age of 111. As Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/index.php?a=495">has more</a> about Patch on the band&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m certainly all for paying a small amount of money to get a song and help a cause, it would have been slightly more convenient if the ban had chosen one of the more popular methods to distribute the song online, meaning iTunes or Amazon. Entering all your credit card and billing information just to get one $1.70 song is kind of a pain. But of course, had they distributed through iTunes or Amazon, it may have meant less money going to the cause.</p>
<p>You can find the song and a preview of it <a href="http://download.waste.uk.com/Store/did.html">here</a>.</p>

What is it with all the toolbar copycat craziness lately.  First, there was <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/26/digg-is-working-on-a-toolbar-to-go-after-stumbleupon-tinyurl-and-all-the-rest/">Digg going after StumbleUpon </a>with the Diggbar.  Then StumbleUpon, which <a href="  http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/30/stumbleupon-set-for-resurgence-with-web-toolbar-partner-program/">already had a toolbar</a>, introduced a new toolbar/URL shortening service <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/stumbleupons-supr-url-shortening-service-is-now-in-private-beta-250-invites/">called Su.pr</a>.  

Now, micro-blogging service <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is getting in on the act with its own toolbar which it is calling <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tumblupon">TumbleUpon</a>.  Could they try to be more blatant in ripping off StumbleUpon?  The toolbar has a random Stumble-like shuffle button which randomly takes you through different Tumblogs in a similar way that StumbleUpon's toolbars do. On the right there is a heart button if you want to "like" a page, a reblog button and a button that takes you to your own Tumblr dashboard.  ]]></description>

<p>What is it with all the toolbar copycat craziness lately.  First, there was <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/26/digg-is-working-on-a-toolbar-to-go-after-stumbleupon-tinyurl-and-all-the-rest/">Digg going after StumbleUpon </a>with the Diggbar.  Then StumbleUpon, which <a href="  http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/30/stumbleupon-set-for-resurgence-with-web-toolbar-partner-program/">already had a toolbar</a>, introduced a new toolbar/URL shortening service <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/stumbleupons-supr-url-shortening-service-is-now-in-private-beta-250-invites/">called Su.pr</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, micro-blogging service <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is getting in on the act with its own toolbar which it is calling <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tumblupon">TumbleUpon</a>.  Could they try to be more blatant in ripping off StumbleUpon?  The toolbar has a random Stumble-like shuffle button which randomly takes you through different Tumblogs in a similar way that StumbleUpon&#8217;s toolbars do. On the right there is a heart button if you want to &#8220;like&#8221; a page, a reblog button and a button that takes you to your own Tumblr dashboard.  </p>
<p>StumbleUpon&#8217;s Su.pr toolbar, in comparison, also has a random shuffle button for discovering pages Websites other people have Stumbled, and a &#8220;like&#8221; button.  But Su.pr is a URL shortener with powerful analytics on the backend, while TumbleUpon is not. It is just a discovery tool which surfaces other Tumblogs of people who have overlapping &#8220;likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>So is this a joke?  Yes, and no.  Tumblr founder David Karp tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was really an experiment to see how a tool like StumbleUpon would work for Tumblr content.  Based on the feedback, it seems to be doing a pretty good job.  We really like that it&#8217;s the first Tumblr discovery tool that shows off all of the pretty user created themes while exploring content. . . . </p>
<p>We might wind up changing the name when we start promoting it in the Dashboard <img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p></blockquote>
<p>In a blog post today, Karp also <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/156436390/taking-over-the-world">shares some growth stats</a>. He claims that in July, 2009, Tumblr had 50 million visitors, 255 million impressions, 650,000 new posts per day, and 5,000 new users per day.  </p>
<p>Tumblr is definitely growing, but comScore estimates a much smaller number of users: only 3.9 million uniques worldwide in June, 2009 and 68 million pageviews.  That is a 3X increase in unique visitors over a year ago and a 12X increase in pageviews, but a far cry from the numbers Karp is putting out.  </p>
<p>I asked Karp what could explain this disparity.  He pointed out that 15 percent of Tumblr&#8217;s blogs are on custom domains, and that the 50 million number is for visitors per Google Analytics.  The same person can be a visitor more than once.  Google counts 20 million unique visitors, and Quantcast counts <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/tumblr.com">13 million worldwide</a>.  The site is verified by Quantcast, so I&#8217;d go with that number.  Any way you count it, though, the service is showing strong growth.</p>
<p>But really, TumbleUpon?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/googlechromelogo.png" width="196" height="187" />

Google just released a new <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/beta/">beta version</a> of its Chrome browser for Windows PCs.  The company claims that it is <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-beta-why-slow-down-when-you-can.html">30 percent faster </a> than the current <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">stable version</a> of the browser (based on V8 and SunSpider benchmarks).  

What may be more significant, though, is that this is the first version of Chrome that adds some support for <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML5</a>, including video-tagging capabilities.  The latest <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/09/demo-firefox-35-treats-videos-like-web-pages-why-cant-flash-do-that/">Firefox 3.5 beta</a> also adopts HTML5, which allows for all sorts of cool things inside Web video like links and other interactive elements.  It lets you treat video more like a Webpage.  Along with Google's <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/google-acquires-video-compression-technology-company-on2-for-106-million/">acquisition of On2</a> today for its video codec, it looks like Google is getting behind open video in a big way.  (Read this post from last year for more on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/05/the-next-gen-web-html5-will-we-ever-see-a-real-standard/">evolution of HTML</a>).  ]]></description>

<p>The new Google Chrome beta is also prettier.  Those<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/04/google-chrome-official-themes-collect-all-29-but-some-make-your-eyes-bleed/"> themes we&#8217;ve been telling you about</a> are now fully incorporated.  And the new beta also improves the New Tab and Omnibox features.</p>
<p>When you create a new tab, Chrome shows you thumbnails of the sites you visits the most often (just like in Safari).  These act as automatic bookmarks.  Now, you can rearrange the thumbnails in any order you like by dragging and dropping them, or you can pin one down so that it doesn&#8217;t move even if you don&#8217;t visist it as much as other sites.</p>
<p>The Omnibox is Chrome&#8217;s all-in-one address and search bar.  As you type words in, it gives you drop-down suggestions, which now have icons distinguishing between search results, bookmarks, and Websites.</p>

But "view" is the keyword there. You could only watch it, you could not record and send your own video back from the iPhone. But starting today, you finally can.

The new Ustream Recorder is a free application available in Apple's App Store that allows you to send video from your iPhone to the web. Unfortunately, despite <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/16/ustream-may-be-first-to-broadcast-video-from-unhacked-iphone/">long-standing talk</a> that it might be able to send live video from your iPhone to the web, that is not the case. Instead, Ustream appears to be attempting to use some spin by calling it a "live-to-recorded video recorder" — um, okay, isn't <em>all</em> video at some point technically recorded live? Yes, it is.

Mentioning "live" was not necessary here because this app does not stream video live. Not that it's Ustream's fault, it's Apple that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/looking-forward-to-streaming-live-video-from-your-iphone-3g-s-not-so-fast/">doesn't currently allow</a> apps that do that in the App Store. So instead, this app records video and then uploads it to the web. The problem is that there are already a number of other apps out there that do this, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/23/kytes-iphone-3gs-app-doesnt-live-stream-but-its-fast-with-nice-quality/">like Kyte</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/while-we-wait-for-12seconds-robust-app-we-get-a-dead-simple-one/">12cast</a>.

But &#8220;view&#8221; is the keyword there. You could only watch it, you could not record and send your own video back from the iPhone. But starting today, you finally can.</p>
<p>The new Ustream Recorder is a free application available in Apple&#8217;s App Store that allows you to send video from your iPhone to the web. Unfortunately, despite <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/16/ustream-may-be-first-to-broadcast-video-from-unhacked-iphone/">long-standing talk</a> that it might be able to send live video from your iPhone to the web, that is not the case. Instead, Ustream appears to be attempting to use some spin by calling it a &#8220;live-to-recorded video recorder&#8221; — um, okay, isn&#8217;t <em>all</em> video at some point technically recorded live? Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Mentioning &#8220;live&#8221; was not necessary here because this app does not stream video live. Not that it&#8217;s Ustream&#8217;s fault, it&#8217;s Apple that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/looking-forward-to-streaming-live-video-from-your-iphone-3g-s-not-so-fast/">doesn&#8217;t currently allow</a> apps that do that in the App Store. So instead, this app records video and then uploads it to the web. The problem is that there are already a number of other apps out there that do this, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/23/kytes-iphone-3gs-app-doesnt-live-stream-but-its-fast-with-nice-quality/">like Kyte</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/while-we-wait-for-12seconds-robust-app-we-get-a-dead-simple-one/">12cast</a>. But Ustream wants to challenge them on the iPhone by offering more options.</p>
<p>The app gives you the option to share you videos to Ustream, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook or Ustream on Facebook. This makes the app much more flexible than its competitors when it comes to deciding where you want to send your video. Ustream also promises high-quality video from the app, which isn&#8217;t a surprise given the quality that Kyte&#8217;s app outputs.</p>
<p>Also interesting is that the app allows edit and manage videos that are already up on Ustream, even if they weren&#8217;t recorded with the iPhone. You simply pull download them to edit them.</p>
<p>But the reason why Ustream isn&#8217;t too bummed about its app not offering live-streaming is that they envisioned it used in another way, with another new service they&#8217;re launching.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-89737" title="1" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/1.png" alt="1" width="351" height="431" />Called &#8220;Media Stream,&#8221; it&#8217;s a functionality that basically allows broadcasters to pull in other video clips to supplement their own streams. Imagine it this way: Say you&#8217;re watching the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/crunchcam/">CrunchCam</a>, but one of the TechCrunch reporters has just shot a cool video and uploaded it. Assuming they had the correct privileges, that video would then show up as a thumbnail below the live feed. And if a user clicked on it, they could watch it.</p>
<p>Again, that is pre-recorded video being sent in from the iPhone, but such a use-case actually sounds pretty cool. And for publishers it&#8217;s fairly flexible. You can accept videos from anyone that submits them if they use a hashtag that you set (to be able to identify the right videos). You can then choose to accept certain videos into your feed on a case-by-case basis. Or you can approve certain users ahead of time so that their videos will definitely show up in your stream.</p>
<p>The functionality works on Ustream and on embeds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing that the app doesn&#8217;t offer live video streaming, but again, that&#8217;s not Ustream&#8217;s fault (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/25/qik-brings-live-video-to-the-iphone-3gs-but-you-still-wont-find-it-in-the-app-store/">Qik can only do it by bypassing</a> the App Store with an Ad-Hoc install method). But a nice set up upload options and this new Media Stream capability should make Ustream&#8217;s app a good option in an increasingly crowded iPhone 3GS video app field.</p>

Twitter is being sued again, and this time it isn't some <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/hey-there-tony-la-russa-is-suing-twitter/">angry baseball manager</a> who doesn't like people impersonating him on the service.

Twitter is being sued for patent infringement by <a href="http://www.techradium.com/">TechRadium</a>, a Texas-based technology company which makes mass notification systems for public safety organizations, the military, and utilities.

<p>Twitter is being sued again, and this time it isn&#8217;t some <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/04/hey-there-tony-la-russa-is-suing-twitter/">angry baseball manager</a> who doesn&#8217;t like people impersonating him on the service.  This time it is a little more serious.  Twitter is being sued for patent infringement by <a href="http://www.techradium.com/">TechRadium</a>, a Texas-based technology company which makes mass notification systems for public safety organizations, the military, and utilities.  </p>
<p>TechRadium is basically claiming that it thought up the whole concept of mass notifications first, and points to three issued patents: Nos. <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gUR7AAAAEBAJ&#038;dq=7,130,389">7,130,389,</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=5PSzAAAAEBAJ&#038;dq=7,496,183">7,496,183</a>, and <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&#038;Sect2=HITOFF&#038;d=PALL&#038;p=1&#038;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&#038;r=1&#038;f=G&#038;l=50&#038;s1=7,519,165.PN.&#038;OS=PN/7,519,165&#038;RS=PN/7,519,165">7,519,165</a>.  According to the lawsuit, which was filed yesterday on August 4, 2009 in Houston, Texas (full document embedded at bottom of post):</p>
<blockquote><p>TechRadium develops, sells, and services mass notification systems that allow a group administrator or “message Author” to originate a single message that will be delivered simultaneously via multiple communication gateways to members of a group of “message Subscribers.”  A member of a subscriber group can receive such message in their choice of any combination of voice message, text message e-mail and so on.  This technology is patented by the Plaintiff, TechRadium, and marketed under the trade name “IRIS”™ (Immediate Response Information System).  Among other things, the patented IRIS™ technology eliminated the need for an Author to send multiple identical messages, and allowed Subscribers to select the most convenient form of notification for them. </p></blockquote>
<p>Twitter works across text messaging and e-mail, but not voicemail (yet).  The very concept of unifying different message communication systems is what is in dispute here.  Whatever the merits of the lawsuit, you can&#8217;t say Twitter didn&#8217;t see this one coming.  Way back in a February, 2009 strategy meeting (see <a href=" http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/16/twitters-internal-strategy-laid-bare-to-be-the-pulse-of-the-planet/">Twitter Papers</a>), the company discussed potential legal threats.</p>
<blockquote><p>Legal </p>
<p>•	We will be sued for patent infringement, repeatedly and often. </p>
<p>•	Should we get a great patent attorney to proactively go after these patents (We need to talk about this more, we are unsatisfied)</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope it hired that &#8220;great patent attorney&#8221; because this could just be the beginning.</p>

<big><strong>SEC Watch</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.secwatch.com">http://www.secwatch.com</a></p>
<p>SEC Watch deals with a big problem facing individuals interested in research and investing—a mountain of invaluable data exists in SEC filings, but those filings are really difficult to deal with as an information source.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people are dealing with filings many hours after they are issued, letting those with real-time access have first mover advantage</li>
<li>The sheer volume of filings each day is massive (in 2008 alone, there were over 1MM filings, totaling 15 million pages )</li>
<li>The search experience offered online by finance sites and the government is very crude in functionality</li>
<li>There is no easy way to collaborate with others on the analysis, and share comments/observations</li>
</ul>
<p>Why does this all matter?  Well, if you had looked at AIG’s filings, for instance, you could have found information about their sub-prime mortgage exposure almost a year before things blew up.  It was just buried in a footnote.</p>
<p>SEC Watch brings state of the art search technology, combined with user annotation and sharing capabilities to the problem, and has crafted a compelling product that both retail and professional investors and analysts can use.  It is easy to track companies and keywords (e.g., “subprime”,”litigation”, etc.), and get automated results in near real-time when filings are posted that match your criteria.  You can then dive down to the relevant sections, and annotate a given filing for your own personal use, your team’s use, or to share with the public.</p>

<p><big><strong>Bandsintown</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.bandsintown.com/login">http://www.bandistown.com</a></p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-17.png" class="shot2" /></p>
<p>Bandsintown addresses a big shift in the whole economics of the music business.  Nowadays, 70% of a band’s income comes not from music sales, but from touring.  That’s up from 20% only four years ago.  Ticket sales have never been more important, but the marketplace for tickets has become incredibly fragmented.  There are 70+ separate ticket marketplaces on the web.  That makes for a bad experience for a fan, but also a bad experience for music sites trying to encourage ticket sales for all the different artists they feature.</p>
<p>Bandsintown has dealt with this problem by building interfaces to 62 different ticket marketplaces, and then exposing all ticketing information as a simple to use API that music sites can integrate.  They have increased their traffic to over 500K monthly unique visitors in the five months since they launched their API, and have a global partner base (including <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, the <a href="http://hypem.com/">Hype Machine</a>, and <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/">PureVolume</a> among others).</p>
<p>Bandsintown automatically plugs into music players such as iTunes, last.fm, Pandora and other sites to learn your artist preferences, and then lets you track your favorite artists (and related ones) and receive alerts when events of interest are coming to your area.  They are also preparing to release a new iPhone app (it’s awaiting approval from Apple) that lets you see local concerts based on your musical tastes and geo-location— think of it as Urban Spoon for live music.</p>
<p>There is lots of other good stuff too, like live event twitter integration to allow you to easily track both yours and others’ concert experiences.  If you love live music, you’ll love Bandsintown.</p>

<p><big><strong>Social Collective</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.thesocialcollective.com/" >http://www.thesocialcollective.com/</a><br />
<img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-181.png" class="shot2"/></p>
<p>Social Collective addresses the huge market of conferences and corporate meetings.  There are an incredible 1.2 million conferences and corporate meeting in the US each year.  It is a huge industry—close to $11 billion is spent worldwide.  The problem is that in these tough economic times, revenue for event producers is down, and the demands from attendees and sponsors is up, as they want more for their dollar.</p>
<p>Social Collective is a browser-based service targeted at event marketing and the enhancement of the event experience for both attendees and sponsors.  They powered SXSW this year, as well as the Oracle Open World and other big events.</p>
<p>They bring innovation to a pretty under-served industry by allowing things like crowd-sourced agenda design, social graph importing for attendees to reach out to friends and associates attending the same event, marketing tools for pre and post event awareness building by conference organizers, and tools for vendor communications and networking with attendees.</p>
<p>The service has been great in helping both long-standing events re-invigorate themselves, as well as first-time events get their word out to the marketplace.  They have both web and mobile experiences covered, and do some really nice things like allowing you to build your own tailored agenda for an event, and then import it into your online calendar. (FYI, this custom-agenda function was very popular at SXSW, with over 60% penetration).</p>

<p><big><strong>TapMetrics</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.tapmetrics.com/" >http://www.tapmetrics.com/</a><br />
<img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-19.png" class="shot2" /></p>
<p>TapMetrics is a tool designed by a team of iPhone application developers that brings together sales data, user feedback, software metrics, and other information into a consolidated dashboard to allow developers to manage a portfolio of applications quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The whole experience starts with a dashboard that lets you view important information about how your application portfolio is performing, and then lets you drill into each application to investigate any issue that is highlighted.  The nice part of the TapMetrics solution is that while it does a great job on the business metrics of running an iPhone application, it does just as good of a job serving the needs of the engineer.  Everything from detailed environmental data (which iPhone/Touch hardware is being used, which OS level, which release level of the application), to detailed crash reporting, to application messaging/event logs, and session tracking are supported within the integrated TapMetrics experience.  That integration of both business and technical data (including session-level tracking) in a single dashboard is something no one else does today.</p>
<p>They also have a free iPhone app called TapMini that you can use to track sales data for your applications.  If you are trying to get more out of your iPhone application portfolio (both in terms of improving the consumer experience and making more revenue), this can be an essential tool.</p>

<big><strong>Unblab</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.unblab.com/" >http://www.unblab.com/</a></p>
<p>Unblab is trying to attack the email overload problem by answering the question “What emails should I be reading”?  They are approaching this by building a cloud-based service that uses common and user-specific rules to identify and prioritize important email messages.  Think of it as attacking the email overload problem from the opposite end of the spectrum as the anti-spam vendors, but using similar technologies.</p>
<p>The latest productivity studies have white-collar workers now spending 4 hours a day in email-related activities, and the volume of legitimate inbox messages increasing 10% per year.  The challenge is how to approach better management of that legitimate traffic.</p>
<p>Unblab has two products it is deploying initially to help refine its algorithms and demonstrate the value of its ranking system, which it calls &#8220;Importance ranking.&#8221;.  One product is a Gmail add-on called GTriage, and the other is a mobile app called iTriage.  The goal is to get early-stage learnings on the differences of what’s “important” when you are on a mobile device with  limited real estate as compared to when you are using a pc-based webmail experience.</p>
<p>The API for the service will be opened up to developers to define their own user experiences (and to allow additional training events/algorithmic enhancements).</p>

<p><big><strong>KeepFu</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.keepfu.com/" >http://www.keepfu.com/</a></p>
<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-231.png" class="shot2" /></p>
<p>KeepFu is a simple note-taking and organization tool to help manage consumer-defined “projects” like trip planning, event planning, and important purchases.  The team has built a good Evernote-like note taking tool called Ubernote, and while they got some decent initial traction, they realized there were some key unmet needs that the whole web note-taking space was failing to serve.</p>
<p>Feedback from their own user based shaped this next-generation offering.  This new product, KeepFu, is addressing the organization of information, not just the collection of it.  KeepFu collects data through one-click and passive data collection while a user reads an email, visits a website, IMs with a friend, or send a Tweet.  It then supports a quick drag and drop experience to organize these information snippets into community-created project templates (predefined file folders specific to an activity, like planning a trip).  These projects are then easily published or shared.</p>
<p>The goal is to allow information capture without forcing a user to change context and leave the experience they are engaged in, and then support automated and manual classification and organization of the information when it is appropriate, a bit like the weekly photo tagging activity of Facebook users.  Simple collection, organization, and sharing is what KeepFu is all about.</p>

<p><big><strong>Keen Guides</strong></big><br />

<p>Keen Guides started from the personal experience of its founder, a hearing-impaired woman who was visiting a very popular museum in Washington, DC and wanted to have her own tour experience.  They handed her a dog-eared pile of paper, and sent her on her way.  Trying to come up with a better experience, she went home and made a sign language version of the commentary as video clips she then viewed the next day on her iPod as she toured the Gallery.  It was a transformative experience for her, and that’s when Keen Guides was born.</p>
<p>The goals of the company are simple:  Leverage new platforms (especially the iPhone) to replace outdated audio wands as content delivery tools.  Create self-paced custom tours, based on prior visitor feedback, what time you have available, and your unique interests. Encourage social interaction and sharing of comments, photos, etc., by tour participants.  Support access by all, including hearing and vision impaired visitors, as well as non-English speakers.</p>
<p>They are using the iPhone as their initial tour delivery platform, and will support tour content creation (and monetization) by both themselves as well as third parties like DC By Foot.  Initial deployments include museums, city walking tours, and college campuses (for orientation tours.).</p>

<big><strong>Legal River</strong></big><br />
URL: <a href="http://www.legalriver.com/" >http://www.legalriver.com/</a></p>
<p>Legal River is focused on providing a marketplace for matching small businesses with legal professionals.  Looking at search queries, you see a lot of businesses searching for uniquely skilled legal professional in areas like patent law, contract disputes, and other specialties.</p>
<p>While there are numerous directory sites for lawyers, they don’t encourage the concept of competing for a given business’s project, and do little to give prior client feedback and other useful data that would help a business owner to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Legal River has created a marketplace where a business can anonymously post a given project and get competitive bids from multiple subject-matter experts.  The system allows easy side-by-side comparison of credentials, prices, and prior client feedback on similar projects.  The net result is a better, more transparent process that serves both the business owner as well as the legal professional, who gets access to high-quality local leads.</p>
<p>Legal River has signed distribution deals with a number of sites to both get their service offering in front of small business owners, as well as qualified local lawyers.</p>

<p>The New York-based company, which operates a management platform designed to connect buyers and sellers of online media, had previously raised <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/traffiq">$7 million</a> from the latter investor and says the extra capital will be primarily used to enhance its TRAFFIQ platform and accelerate the company’s sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>TRAFFIQ positions itself as different from ad networks or exchanges, in the sense that they offer an end-to-end platform that is capable of consolidating planning, RFP distribution, order execution, optimization and billing. Its solution is targeted primarily to larger ad agencies like Havas Digital, IMRE and AdStrategies and publishers like WhitePages.com, Scripps Network and ContextWeb. The service also boasts the inclusiong of reporting and free ad serving tools, as well as integration with common third-party ad-serving technologies like Atlas and DoubleClick&#8217;s DART.</p>
<p>The company claims &#8220;millions of dollars of campaign demand and billions of impressions&#8221; are currently available on its TRAFFIQ platform, although it didn&#8217;t go into specifics.</p>

<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/inmobi-2.jpg" class="shot" />The startup is certainly performing pretty well in a very crowded market. </p>
<p>Based on our understanding of their eCPMs and monthly ad impressions (which range up to 2 billion per month and growing), it looks like they are currently grossing over $1m in mobile ad revenues per month. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not too shabby, and if you consider that the eCPM rates they informed us about are based on averages from their operations on the Asian and African mobile markets, it&#8217;s conceivable that they&#8217;re looking at multiplying that revenue soon. </p>
<p>That is, if they manage to get traction in Europe, where eCPMs are generally much higher. If they book some early success, the company says it will be on track to become cash-flow positive later this year.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mobile advertising service - which is targeted more to the mobile web than applications - is currently available in over 23 countries and cites advertisers like Reebok, Yamaha, Cricket Nirvana and MakeMyTrip.</p>
<p><del datetime="2009-08-05T13:23:14+00:00">mKhoj</del> InMobi has offices in Palo Alto, India and Singapore. The company raised a total of <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/inmobi">$7.6 million</a> to date, starting out with a $500k seed round from a group of angel investors and followed up by a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/16/mkhoj-rings-in-71-million-in-series-a-funding-from-kpcb-and-sherpalo/">multi-million financing round</a> led by Kleiner Perkins, Caufield &#038; Byers and Sherpalo Ventures (the VC firm started by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ram-shriram">Ram Shriram</a>, early backer and founding board member of Google).</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/on2.jpg" class="shot2" /><a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.on2.com/">On2 Technologies</a> jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire On2, a developer of video compression technology. The acquisition is expected to close later this year. On2 markets video compression technologies that power high-quality video in both desktop and mobile applications and devices and also holds a number of interesting <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&#038;STORY=/www/story/05-30-2006/0004370419&#038;EDATE=">patents</a>. </p>
<p>Some of its codec designs are known as VP3, VP4, VP5, TrueMotion VP6, TrueMotion VP7 and VP8. Its customers include Adobe, Skype, Nokia, Infineon, Sun Microsystems, Mediatek, Sony, Brightcove, and Move Networks. On2, formerly known as The Duck Corporation, is headquartered in Clifton Park, NY.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of On2 common stock will be converted into $0.60 worth of Google class A common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is valued at approximately $106.5 million. </p>
<p>According to the release, $0.60 per share represents a premium of approximately 57% over the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=on2">closing price</a> of On2&#8217;s common stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the announcement of the transaction, and a premium of approximately 62% over the average closing price of On2&#8217;s common stock for the six month period immediately prior to the announcement of the transaction.</p>
<p>Important to note is that On2 once had a market cap in excess of $1 billion at its peak, after going public on the American Stock Exchange in 1999 following a merger with Applied Capital Funding (which was already listed at the time). Before its entry on the public market, The Duck Corporation had raised $6.5M in venture capital funding from Edelson Technology Partners and Citigroup Ventures.</p>
<p>Back in 2001, On2 made waves by releasing their VP3 compression technology to the open-source community, including their patents on the technology. The technology lives on in the form of (Ogg) <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a>. You can find more information about this <a href="http://lockshot.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/whats-the-problem-with-ogg-theora/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The agreement is subject to On2 stockholder approval, regulatory clearances and other closing conditions.</p>
<p>Google is reluctant to dive into specific regarding the product plans until after the deal closes, although it&#8217;s conceivably related to its immensely popular video service <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a>. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/innovation-in-video-on-web.html">blog post</a>, the company says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although we&#8217;re not in a position to discuss specific product plans until after the deal closes, we are committed to innovation in video quality on the web, and we believe that On2 Technologies&#8217; team and technology will help us further that goal.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update everybody when we&#8217;re able to share more information. In the meantime, nothing will change for On2 Technologies&#8217; current and prospective customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If would be great if Google decides to open-source On2&#8217;s VP7 and VP8 video codecs and free them up as the worldwide video codec standards, thus becoming alternatives to the proprietary and licenced H264 codecs. On2 has always claimed VP7 is better quality than H264 at the same bitrate. </p>
<p>Also noteworthy: Google could use the VP8 codec for YouTube in HTML5 mode, basically forcing its many users to upgrade to HTML5-compliant browsers instead of using Flash formats.</p>
<p>Smart move by Google, and possibly great news for innovation in web-based video viewing.</p>
<p>Expect updates if and when we learn more.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/listia-215x121.jpg" width="215" height="121" />New <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/y-combinator">Y Combinator</a> funded startup <a href="http://www.listia.com">Listia</a> launched this morning, and I already love it. It's a really smart way to give stuff away for free.

We tend to give away a lot of the random stuff people send us at TechCrunch. Some of it is trivial - stickers, tshirts, etc. But sometimes it's decent electronic stuff - we get a lot of iPod touches with demo apps to review, for example, and usually the company doesn't want them back so we give them away to people. Earlier this week I <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/3098076255">gave away</a> a wireless Google-branded mouse on Twitter, and <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/3098114741">pondered</a> setting up a Twitter account just to give away all the test stuff cluttering our office.

Often people <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/zip/">list free things</a> on <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/craigslist">Craigslist</a> or donate it to Goodwill, charities or churches.

But Craigslist isn't a perfect solution, since you will get a mass of emails and need to deal with everyone. And often the winner doesn't show up. And most charities and churches aren't really interested in getting actual stuff that they then need to sell for cash. Listia makes it all a lot better.]]></description>

It&#8217;s a really smart way to give stuff away for free.</p>
<p>We tend to give away a lot of the random stuff people send us at TechCrunch. Some of it is trivial - stickers, tshirts, etc. But sometimes it&#8217;s decent electronic stuff - we get a lot of iPod touches with demo apps to review, for example, and usually the company doesn&#8217;t want them back so we give them away to people. Earlier this week I <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/3098076255">gave away</a> a wireless Google-branded mouse on Twitter, and <a href="http://twitter.com/arrington/status/3098114741">pondered</a> setting up a Twitter account just to give away all the test stuff cluttering our office.</p>
<p>Often people <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/zip/">list free things</a> on <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/craigslist">Craigslist</a> or donate it to Goodwill, charities or churches.</p>
<p>But Craigslist isn&#8217;t a perfect solution, since you will get a mass of emails and need to deal with everyone. And often the winner doesn&#8217;t show up. And most charities and churches aren&#8217;t really interested in getting actual stuff that they then need to sell for cash. They&#8217;d rather just get the cash.</p>
<p>Listia makes it all a lot better. Users don&#8217;t bid cash for items, rather they bid points that they get for free for signing up, listing items and referring friends. That means the winner is the person who wanted the item the most and was willing to bid the most points. The lister doesn&#8217;t have to deal with a lot of emails, and the no-show risk is minimized.</p>
<p>And if a user really wants an item but doesn&#8217;t have enough points, they can buy more. That&#8217;s where the business model comes in, and the value to charities.</p>
<p>Points can be purchased at a rate of $5 for 50 points. And if a lister decides to donate the proceeds to charity, the charity gets 60% of any paid for points used by the winner.</p>
<p><img src='http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/listia2.jpg'class="snap_nopreview shot2" alt="" />If it sounds complicated, just see this <a href="http://listia.com/13U?r=203">listing that I created</a> this morning giving away a Nokia N95 phone and donating the proceeds to the American Red Cross (yes, you can get that phone for free if you hurry).</p>
<p>The service is fully working now but a lot of features are still baking. The selection of charities is very limited (more being added soon, the company says). And soon Listia will let you add other charities, give accumulated points to charity, etc. It&#8217;s a no brainer for charities to encourage their supporters to use something like this to donate actual items, and Listia says they are busy creating features to accommodate that.</p>
<p>The company was founded by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/gee-chuang">Gee Chuang</a> and <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/james-fong">James Fong</a> </p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/wideorbit.png" class="shot2" />Google Radio, the Internet search and advertising giant&#8217;s online radio ad buying service, has been sold to online ad and media management software firm <a href="http://www.wideorbit.com/wideorbit.com/index.php/products/wo-automation-for-radio.html">WideOrbit</a> for an undisclosed sum.

<p>As expected, WideOrbit is taking over several assets of Google&#8217;s radio business, namely <a href="http://www.google.com/radioautomation/">Google Radio Automation</a>, Maestro and SS32 automation products. The company, which is backed by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wideorbit">at least $34.5 million</a> in venture capital, commented on the closing of the deal saying that it was looking to expand its product portfolio and taking over Google Radio&#8217;s assets was a key step in that process. In the released statement, the company added that 3,600 customers were currently using Google Radio Automation.</p>
<p>WideOrbit, founded in 1999, claims to help manage over $12 billion in online advertising from about 1300 cable networks, TV and radio stations, as well as managing advertising for movie theaters, mobile devices, and digital display networks. It boasts clients such as NBC, Telemundo, Hearst Television, and Gannett, among others. </p>

A new 128-page presentation called "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">Reference Guide on our Freedom &#38; Responsibility Culture</a>" was recently sent around the company, and then put on SlideShare, where the blog Hacking Netflix <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/08/netflix-posted-a-128-page-internal-presentation-on-the-company-culturereference-guide-on-our-freedom-responsibility-culture.html">found it</a>.

A new 128-page presentation called &#8220;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">Reference Guide on our Freedom &amp; Responsibility Culture</a>&#8221; was recently sent around the company, and then put on SlideShare, where the blog Hacking Netflix <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/08/netflix-posted-a-128-page-internal-presentation-on-the-company-culturereference-guide-on-our-freedom-responsibility-culture.html">found it</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation, which you can see for yourself below, is as interesting as any 128-page document can be. If you read it over, about half-way through, you&#8217;ll probably start wishing you worked for Netflix. This was meant to be an internal document for employees to read, but it&#8217;s also one hell of a recruitment pitch.</p>
<p>Early on, a lot of it deals with workplace efficiency, and not being afraid to let someone go if they&#8217;re not doing their job. The idea is that if someone just wants to do mediocre works, that&#8217;s fine, they&#8217;ll get a nice severance package. It extends this into an emphasis on effectiveness over effort — the company doesn&#8217;t want to necessarily reward people who stay late versus those who don&#8217;t, but get the same amount of work done. It then turns to some internal policies including management best practices. And then to retention practices — making sure the company pays the top people a high enough salary that they&#8217;ll never want to leave.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a big emphasis within the company on salary, rather than stock options and bonuses. The thought is that you should give the employees as much money as possible up front and let them decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>This is all pretty interesting stuff for a fairly large, publicly-traded company. The emphasis is obviously not to act like other big companies do. Given Netflix&#8217;s recent successes, it would seem that the strategy is working. And yes, there is stuff in there about the vacation policy.</p>

Apparently, one of Google's Chrome UI designers, Glen Murphy, has inserted his face into the latest nightly build of Chrome. Specifically, this is the Linux build, which is meant for developers and testers (we haven't been able to see it on the Mac or Windows versions).]]></description>
					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is just kind of odd. Look at the picture below. See the picture of some guy in place of the &#8220;X&#8221; button? Yeah, that&#8217;s <a href="http://glenmurphy.com/blog/">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, one of Google&#8217;s Chrome UI designers, Glen Murphy, has inserted his face into the latest nightly build of Chrome. Specifically, this is the Linux build, which is meant for developers and testers (we haven&#8217;t been able to see it on the Mac or Windows versions).</p>
<p>Our tipster was pretty surprised when he downloaded the nightly build and saw a person&#8217;s face staring back at him, so he asked around on the Chromium irc channel, and found out it was Murphy (who you can see <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/schedule/?action=bio&amp;id=100464">in a picture here</a> from SXSW three years ago).</p>
<p>Apparently, the next update will remove Murphy&#8217;s face. Oh those Googlers, always messing around.</p>

We already know that it's serving as an entry point for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">the new Chrome OS</a>, but Google isn't just going to sit around and wait for that, it's starting to optimize its experience for netbooks already.

Tonight, Google has just <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-in-labs-hide-labels-see-subject.html">released</a> a small new feature in Gmail Labs so that users can optimize their email service for viewing on netbooks.

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-89705" title="labnolab" src="http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/labnolab.png" alt="labnolab" width="364" height="238" />Google is clearly enamored with the netbook space. We already know that it&#8217;s serving as an entry point for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/google-drops-a-nuclear-bomb-on-microsoft-and-its-made-of-chrome/">the new Chrome OS</a>, but Google isn&#8217;t just going to sit around and wait for that, it&#8217;s starting to optimize its experience for netbooks already.</p>
<p>Tonight, Google has just <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-in-labs-hide-labels-see-subject.html">released</a> a small new feature in Gmail Labs so that users can optimize their email service for viewing on netbooks. It&#8217;s a small, but noteworthy setting as netbooks have become popular, yet most still run sites just as full-sized laptops would. Gmail&#8217;s engineers apparently had a problem with that, so they launched the new &#8220;Remove Labels from Subjects&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>Basically, this does exactly what it says, removes the labels that are normally in front of subject lines in Gmail. The idea is that this will save a lot of screen real estate, especially on netbooks.</p>
<p>While a lot has been said recently about the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/03/why-schmidt-had-to-go/">growing differences</a> between Apple and Google, this attitude towards the netbook is as good of an example as any. While Apple has said time and time again that it isn&#8217;t interested in the netbook space (at least as it&#8217;s currently comprised), Google is clearly thinking about it a lot.</p>
<p>Google also notes that using its Chrome browser in full screen mode is a good solution for netbooks. That is, of course, until Chrome OS is released.</p>
